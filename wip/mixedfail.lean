# REFUTED: `MixedCoverConj`, and `GuardedMixedConj` with it

`wip/phistar.lean` left the JOIN of the two lower-bound methods open:

    MixedCoverConj : ∀ φ with atoms ⊆ {p}, ∃ finite variable-free S,
                     φ ⊢ Lo φ ∨ ⋁_{θ ∈ S} φ[p := θ]

with `postUI_of_mixedCoverConj` reducing last-variable `∃p` to it.
`wip/guardstretch.lean` weakens it further by allowing the stretch to be
guarded by any finite set of variable-free formulas (`GuardedMixedConj`).
This file refutes BOTH, at

    φ♦ = ((◯⊥ ⊃ p) ∨ ◯⊥ ∨ ¬p) ⊃ ((◯⊥ ∧ p) ∨ (◯⊥ ∧ ¬p)) .

## The countermodel: the DIAMOND

    M♦ :  0 ⊑ 1, 0 ⊑ 2, 1 ⊑ 3, 2 ⊑ 3   (`1`, `2` incomparable)
          Rₘ = id ∪ {(x,3) : x ≠ 0},   F = {3},   V(a) = {1,3}

`◯⊥` holds exactly on `{1,2,3}` (world `0`'s only `Rₘ`-successor is `0`);
`p` holds at `1` and at the fallible `3`, and NOT at `2`.  The
transposition `1 ↔ 2` is a frame automorphism (`sw`), so worlds `1` and
`2` satisfy the same variable-free formulas (`Md_swap`) and `‖p‖` is
undefinable.

At the root, `φ♦` holds: the antecedent fails at `0` (all three
disjuncts do), and above `0` — where `◯⊥` is true — the consequent
reduces to `p ∨ ¬p`, which holds at `1` (`p`), at `2` (`¬p`, since the
only `p`-world above `2` is the fallible `3`) and at `3`.

Every variable-free substitution fails, exactly as at `φ★`
(`Md_inst_fails`): `θ` is true at `1` iff true at `2`, so either `θ`
covers all of `‖◯⊥‖` — and then `◯⊥ ⊃ θ` holds at `0`, so the antecedent
holds at `0` while the consequent cannot (it needs `◯⊥` at `0`) — or `θ`
holds only at the fallible world, and then `¬θ` holds at `0`, again
giving the antecedent.

## Why the stretch does not rescue it, for ANY guard

`gstretch_tr` turns `‖LoG χ φ♦‖` into forcing of `φ♦` at the ground copy
of the root in the `χ`-guarded stretch, and there `φ♦` fails whatever
`χ` is (`Md_gstretch_fails`), by a three-way case split on the guard:

* `1 ⊩ χ` — the upper copy `inr 1` is attached above `inl 1`; it forces
  `p` and is not fallible, so `¬p` fails at `inl 1`, while `p` itself
  fails there (`p` is "fallible" on the ground layer).  So the
  consequent fails at `inl 1` although `◯⊥` — hence the antecedent —
  holds there;
* `2 ⊩ χ` — the same at `inl 2`;
* `1 ⊮ χ` and `2 ⊮ χ` — then the upper layer is attached only over the
  fallible world `3`, so every `p`-world above `inl 0` is fallible and
  `¬p` holds at `inl 0`, giving the antecedent there, while the
  consequent needs `◯⊥` at `inl 0`, which fails.

So `LoG χ φ♦` fails at the root of `M♦` for EVERY guard `χ` — including
guards with variables — and no join of guarded stretch bounds with
substitution instances covers `φ♦`.

## What this does and does not settle

REFUTED: the mixed method, and the guarded mixed method, hence both
reductions `postUI_of_mixedCoverConj` and `postUI_of_guardedMixedConj`
are dead ends as stated.  Uniform interpolation is untouched: as with
`φ★`, whether `∃p.φ♦` exists is OPEN (`PostInterpPhiDiaExists`).  The
only candidate below which it must lie in `M♦` is `⊤`, since the
variable-free truth sets of `M♦` are exactly `{⊥, ◯⊥, ⊤}` and only `⊤`
contains the root; `postInterpPhiDiaIsTop_iff` reduces that candidate to
"every variable-free consequence of `φ♦` is a theorem".

/-! ## Integration addendum: `⊤` is EXCLUDED, not forced — the successor
question is `∃p.φ♦ =? ¬¬◯⊥`

The remark above §"PostInterpPhiDiaIsTop" inferred from `M♦` that `⊤`
is the only candidate value.  That inference is wrong: `M♦` only shows
any interpolant is ⊤-VALUED ON `M♦`, and `¬¬◯⊥` also has full truth
set there (no world of `M♦` forces `¬◯⊥`).  In fact the same two-line
argument as for `φ★` gives `φ♦ ⊢ ¬¬◯⊥` — assume `¬◯⊥`; then
`◯⊥ ⊃ p` holds vacuously, the antecedent's first disjunct fires, and
either disjunct of the consequent yields `◯⊥`, contradiction — so any
uniform post-interpolant of `φ♦` lies BELOW `¬¬◯⊥` and `⊤` is
excluded.  The live question after `guardedMixedConj_false` is
therefore exactly the `φ★`-shape question one construction further
out: `∃p.φ♦ =? ¬¬◯⊥`, now beyond the reach of every guarded
two-layer stretch. -/

/-- **`φ♦ ⊢ ¬¬◯⊥`** — same mechanism as `phiStar_nnbox`. -/
