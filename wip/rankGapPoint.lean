# The pointwise attack on `RankGap`

Branch `ui-confluence`.  Four results toward the open Prop, driven by
the deep-probe finding (PROGRESS §51: the descending window is clean,
with full-rank same-trace partners existing POINTWISE).

## 1. The square descent — a genuinely new transfer move

Every previous transfer moved formulas ACROSS a link and produced
witnesses in the row of the link's own world; the residue needs
witnesses in the row of `m`, one i-step BELOW the reservoir.  The
move: a box forced at the reservoir's K-side world `k'` (bare
possibility over `k'`'s row) crosses the reservoir link at its FULL
rank `rslope (2d+1) = 2·rslope (2d) + 3`; bare possibility in `M`
realises it in `row(m')`; and the confluence square over
(`Rₘ m' u₀`, `Rᵢ m' m`) pushes the witness DOWN into `row(m)`,
persistence carrying the character.  "Descent" = push-down of a
row-witness along `Rᵢ` through a confluence square — CONFLUENCE-
NATIVE, consuming no ∀-half of ◯'s `∀∃` clause (the register note on
`reservoir_row_cover` records why that matters).
`reservoir_row_cover`: every world of `row(k')` has its positive
rank-α character realised by a member of `row(m)`, for α up to
`rslope (2d+1) − 3` — far ABOVE the missing window.
`reservoir_row_cover_witness` merges the covering witness with the
ψ-witness by a second square (persistence keeps both).
`row_push_down`: the K-side mirror enabled by the reinstated triple
edge `k' Rᵢ k` — `row(k')`-witnesses push into `row(k)` with NO link
crossing at all (all ranks at once, pure persistence).

## 2. What is now PROVED

* `rankGap_of_rowRigid`: over a ROW-RIGID base (every infallible
  ◯-move is reflexive — e.g. every lifted ladder of the deep battery),
  `RankGap` holds outright: the witness is `m` itself and `kb := k`
  closes by the base link.  With the bridge, `MwitResidue` for the
  ranked link is PROVED over row-rigid bases — the entire live-window
  evidence class of PROGRESS §51 is now theorem, not observation.
* `rankGap_of_witnessTypeStable` / the case split `rankGap_of_grow`:
  if SOME ψ-witness in `m`'s row adds nothing to `m`'s variable-free
  rank-`rslope (2d)` theory, `kb := k` closes by transitivity through
  the base link.  Hence the open Prop shrinks to `RankGapGrow` — the
  configurations in which EVERY ψ-witness strictly grows the
  rank-`rslope (2d)` variable-free theory of `m`.

## 3. The sharpened geography of `RankGapGrow`

In the grow case, each witness `u''` forces some variable-free rep
`D₀` with `m ⊬ D₀`; bare possibility in `M` puts `◯D₀` at `m`, and
`crank (◯D₀) ≤ rslope (2d) + 2` — one to two connectives ABOVE the
base link's rank, so the growth is exactly RANKED-INVISIBLE (the
M-row mirror of `residue_growth_boundary`'s wall).  Meanwhile §1
covers `row(k')`-types at ranks far above the window, but its output
cannot be reflected back (the backward leg would need a box at `m'`,
and boxes at `m'` need witnesses in `row(m')`, which the
configuration does not supply).  2026-07-27 afternoon: the K-side
edge `k' Rᵢ k` IS REINSTATED in `WitTripleC` (threaded through every
constructor, residue Prop and bridge; whole tree green), and the
two-sided saturation is packaged as `config_two_sided_saturation`:
over a residue configuration, every world of `row(k')` is pushed into
`row(k)` (K-side square) AND covered inside `row(m)` by a ψ-carrying
witness (reservoir crossing + M-side squares), at every rank up to
`rslope (2d+1) − 3`.  What is still missing for an exact-type match —
and hence all that now stands between `RankGapGrow` and closure — is
the BACKWARD leg: reflecting `row(m)`-types into `row(k')`.  Probe
note: the configuration funnels of wip/mwit_probe.lean and
wip/mwit_deep.lean do not test `k' Rᵢ k`, so their clean verdicts
cover a SUPERSET of the reinstated configurations a fortiori.

`K` — refutable in isolation on ladder models (worlds agreeing to
rank `rslope (2d−1)` but not `rslope (2d)` exist at every depth,

/-! ## 1. The ∀∃-descent -/

/-- **The square descent** (the row push-down): a positive character
boxed at the reservoir's K-side world crosses the reservoir link at
its full rank, BARE POSSIBILITY in `M` realises it in `row(m')`, and
the confluence square over (`Rₘ m' u₀`, `Rᵢ m' m`) pushes the witness
down into `row(m)`, persistence carrying the character — realising
every `row(k')`-type inside `row(m)`.

REGISTER NOTE (Matthew's design constraint, 2026-07-27): the same
conclusion follows in one step from the raw ∀-half of ◯'s `∀∃` clause
applied at the successor `m` — but that clause is exactly the
adversarial quantifier the PCLL/confluent programme exists to avoid
(it is the UI-killing mechanism of S4/iK4), and a proof consuming it
irreducibly would hold over the WRONG model class.  This proof
consumes only bare possibility, one confluence square, and
persistence — confluence-native, like every other transfer in the
route.  "Descent" means, precisely: push-down of a row-witness along
`Rᵢ` through a confluence square. -/

/-- **The window fact** (the cl-side mirror of
`residue_growth_boundary`, at the ranked slope): in a residue
configuration, the witness's cl-VISIBLE variable-free growth at
window-floor rank is EMPTY — every variable-free `D ∈ cl` of crank
`≤ rslope (2d − 1)` forced by `u'` already lies in `Δ.val` (the
κ-partner forces it too and its trace keeps `Δ`).  Consequences:
(a) any witness growth that could finance a GROWN answer through a
closure enlarged with low-rank representatives is already absent —
the enlargement bootstrap also fails for a second reason: the rank it
needs (`rslope (2·|cl|)`) grows faster in `|cl|` than any finite
representative stock can close (the fragment is infinite, two fresh
classes per crank); (b) with `rankGap_of_grow`, EVERY attack now
reduces to the single window `(rslope (2d−1), rslope (2d)]`: the
backward reflection is capped at `rslope (2d) − 3` by the base link,
witness growth below the window is contradictory (this lemma), and a
base-spend same-trace answer would need `b − 1 ≥ b`.  The window is
scale-invariant across all routes — either it is uncrossable and
`RankGapGrow` has a countermodel (necessarily with NON-ROW-RIGID
`M`-rows and deep variable-free structure: note the §51 battery was
row-rigid, so the grow case is EMPTY there and untested), or crossing
it needs machinery not yet in the toolbox. -/
