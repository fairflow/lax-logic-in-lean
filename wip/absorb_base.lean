# WIP: the absorption base, ambient-relative form

Hand-executing the pure `gamma_box_map` obligations showed every
boxed γ-position demanding an E-glue one budget below the band — an
infinite regress.  The resolution: the pure statement was stronger
than anything the adequacy landing needs.  The landing always holds
the ambient `E(Γ)`, and with ambient E:

* budget-mono (`E@b ⊢ E@(b-1)`, the easy direction) matches any
  lower guard;
* `box_guard_collapse` opens a guarded box against a ◯-goal;
* `laxL` re-imports ambient at every box crossing, so the inner value
  lands IN CONTEXT — exactly what the pigeonhole/splice shortcut
  consumes (`itp_budget_mono_le` from the repeated state's low value
  into the spliced target slot).

Crux statement (mutual, fuel-inducted; the E-half needs no extra
ambient because E is its own):

    STAB(b):  [E@(b-1)] ⊢ E@b   ∧   E@b, A@b(Γ,C) ⊢ A@(b-1)(Γ,C)

for `b` past the jump-state count.  The cascade lives in the A-half's
jump/γ disjuncts; everything else is the fuel induction.

Case analysis, hand-executed 2026-07-11 (all against the actual
clause tables; the compiler adjudicates next):

E-half `[E@(b-1)] ⊢ E@b` — closes at the fuel level, every case:
* atoms/⊥: project.
* growth conjuncts: E-half fuel-IH at the grown context, composed
  through `andAll_elim`.
* jump conjuncts `(A@(b-1)(A_F) ⇢ E@b(B::Γ))`: impR, fire the
  source's jump conjunct after converting its antecedent by the
  A-half at the (b-1)-pair (IN CONTEXT: the impR antecedent plus the
  source E-value as ambient), then lift the consequent by the E-half
  fuel-IH at the grown context.
* γ conjuncts (the former barrier): impR introduces the target's box
  `◯(E@(b-1) ⇢ A@(b-1)(◯A_F))`; its guard EXACTLY matches the
  in-context source value `E@(b-1)`, so `box_guard_collapse` opens
  it; `laxL` on the result puts `A@(b-1)(◯A_F)` in context; `laxR` +
  impR rebuild the source's γ-antecedent, closing with the A-half at
  the (b-1)-pair.  No regress: ambient is re-imported at the
  crossing.

A-half `[E@b, A@b(Γ,C)] ⊢ A@(b-1)(Γ,C)` — orAll-elim on the source
value with E-ambient:
* goal decomposition: A-half fuel-IH (ambient stepped down by
  `itp_fuel_mono` + `itp_budget_mono`).
* growth disjuncts: impR-texture — introduce the target's guard,
  derive the source's by the E-half at the grown context, fire, then
  A-half at the grown context with the just-derived grown-E as
  ambient.
* SECOND components of jump/γ disjuncts (`A@b(B::Γ, C)`): unlock the
  grown ambient by firing the ambient E-value's own jump conjunct
  with the in-context first component (the adequacy case-map's
  `hfire` pattern), then A-half at the grown context.
* FIRST components of jump/γ disjuncts: the b-descent — THE CASCADE.
  Each jump/γ-first-component map is an A-half instance at the
  (b-1)-pair, whose own jump cases descend again: the descent chain
  carries jump goals (≤ kcap distinct) WITH their values in context
  (andL keeps them).  At a goal repeat: `itp_budget_mono_le` lifts
  the deep in-context value into the spliced (higher-budget) target
  slot.  Pigeonhole bounds the descent by kcap+1, which is what the
  threshold pays for; below it, jump-free target values make the map
  genuinely false.
* trunc: collapse via guard-match, laxL, orAll-elim, reuse the
  per-disjunct bundle (as in itp_sound's trunc case).

Lean plan: outer fuel induction (mutual halves as the ∧); the A-half
jump-first-components via an inner descent lemma carrying
`seen : List (PLLFormula × Nat)` (goal, budget-at-first-visit) with
their values as explicit context hypotheses; repeats close by
mono-splice, fresh states recurse with the budget slack decreasing;
`kcap S < b` supplies the room.

MECHANISATION NOTE (2026-07-11, this file): the compiler adjudicated
the header's claim that the E-half closes at the fuel level.  It does
NOT for the three budget-gated shapes: their antecedent conversions
are (b-1)-pair A-half instances, i.e. instances of the SAME descent
interface the A-half first components need — with the threshold
hypothesis one below what the fuel induction can supply.  So the
cascade interface (the three lemmas below) is consumed from BOTH
halves; everything else closes exactly as the header describes.

MECHANISATION NOTE 2 (2026-07-11, later): the cascade itself is now
mechanised (`cascade_main`), with `kcap` enlarged to the defect-tower
form and the three interface lemmas derived as corollaries.  The
seen-set design survived the compiler with one systematic correction:
the descent must be run in continuation form (the conclusion is a
fixed `R`, each seen goal owns a continuation closing `R` from a
value at the current budget), because the target chain above a splice
cannot be rebuilt after the fact.  The four *sealed* branch shapes —
γ-goal, clause-γ-head, truncation, unpaid fresh antecedent — cannot
carry the continuations across their box/impR introduction and funnel
through `cascade_low`, which splits by saturation: the `defect = 0`
band is proved (`cascade_zero` — every space-guarded clause is dead),
and the `defect ≥ 1` band splits again by box-freeness: the box-free
closed covered instance is proved (`cascade_main_bf`, the shifted
ledger — no ◯-clauses means no seals), leaving the ◯-involving band
as the single sorried holdout `cascade_low_pos_box` (its docstring
records the failure analysis; at those sites only the defect-tower
room survives).

/-! ### The cascade proper

The b-descent, mechanised 2026-07-11.  `cascade_main` is the
generalized lemma (see its docstring): a mutual pair — the lazy
source-side descent in continuation form, and the one-step E-ascent —
by strong induction on the defect with an inner induction on the head
fuel.  The three interface lemmas the stabilization layer consumes
(`cascade_impLImp`, `cascade_jump`, `cascade_gamma`) are corollaries
of the entry wrapper `cascade_entry` at a singleton seen-set; their
statements are unchanged.  Everything is proved except the four
sealed positions, which funnel through the single sorried holdout
`cascade_low` below. -/

/-! #### The generalized descent

`cascade_main` is the lazy source-side cascade in continuation form.
Parameters: `d` bounds the defect (strong induction: grown-context
descents recurse at strictly smaller defect); `fh` is the head fuel
(inner induction: every same-context step peels one table level);
`fuel` is the reference fuel of the continuation interface and of the
packaged ambient; `seen` is the set of jump goals already carrying a
pending target slot, each represented by a continuation `hcls g'` that
closes the fixed conclusion `R` from any `g'`-value at the current
budget `c`.  The current goal `g` is itself in `seen` — its
continuation plays the role of "fill my own slot".  A repeat leaf
invokes the continuation directly on the freshly exposed low value
(mono-lifted); a fresh jump goal recurses with `c − 1`, the new
continuation assembling the enclosing target disjunct (its second
component paid by defect descent) before deferring to the current
goal's continuation.  `hroom` is the ledger: remaining fresh jump
goals + 1 + a full `J+2` allotment per remaining defect level. -/

/-! #### The saturated tier

At `defect S Γ = 0` the space is absorbed (`S ⊆ Γ` as sets): every
space-guarded clause of both tables is dead, the `E`-value is a
budget-independent conjunction of atoms, and the `A`-descent closes by
a plain fuel induction — no jumps, no pigeonhole.  This tier settles
the sealed sites whenever their context is saturated; the holdout
below then only claims the `defect ≥ 1` band. -/

/-! #### The box-free tier

With `S` piece-closed and every formula of `S`, `Γ` and the goal
box-free, all four sealed positions are dead code, and the shifted
ledger (`… ≤ c + (J+2)`: the fresh-chain allotment paid out of the
first defect level) lets the full CPS machinery run from the holdout
sites' own room.  The clone below is `cascade_main` with the seal
branches replaced by gate contradictions and the goal/context
invariants threaded. -/

/-- HOLDOUT — the one remaining `sorry` of the cascade development,
now restricted to the ◯-involving band: by the dispatcher below it
carries, besides `1 ≤ defect S Γ`, the negation `hbox` — some member
of `S` mentions `◯`, or `S` is not subformula-closed, or the goal or
context escapes `S`.  In the complementary (box-free, closed,
covered) instance the descent is a THEOREM (`cascade_low_pos_boxfree`
via `cascade_main_bf`): there are no ◯-clauses, hence no sealed
positions, and the shifted ledger runs the full pigeonhole machine
from this statement's own room.

Stage-3 note (fuel-indifference, `wip/indiff.lean`): re-leveling
fuels above `mu` is an `Eq` in the FUEL dimension; the seal deficit
is in the BUDGET dimension (the seen-discounted room), which
indifference cannot touch — and removing the fuel descent removes the
only decreasing measure the seal-nesting had, so it does not re-fund
the ◯-band either.

The ambient-relative pair descent at *burned* room: only the defect
tower (`defect·(J+2) ≤ c`, `J = |jumpGoals S|`) survives at the call
sites, not the fresh-chain allotment `J+1+defect·(J+2) ≤ c` that
`cascade_main`'s pigeonhole machinery needs at entry.

Consumed from exactly four *sealed* positions inside `cascade_main`'s
A-half, all of shape "the target disjunct must be introduced before
the inner descent runs", so the sequent's conclusion becomes the inner
*value* rather than the fixed outer `R`, and the seen-set
continuations (which conclude `R`) cannot cross:

* the goal-γ disjunct `◯(E ⇢ A(Γ, D))` (laxL demands a ◯-goal — the
  target box must be committed first);
* the clause-γ-head component `◯(E ⇢ A(Γ, ◯A₁))` (same seal);
* the truncation disjunct (same seal, whole-head rebuild);
* the fresh-antecedent goal implication with the new piece outside
  `S` (the impR seals; the defect does not pay).

What was tried (2026-07-11, this session): (a) inheriting the
seen-set across the seal — semantically impossible: continuations
conclude `R`, the sealed obligation is a value, and no g′-value
derives a differently-goaled value; (b) splicing the sealed repeat
into the inner root's own jump disjunct — fails on the second
component (needs the inner goal at a grown context, unavailable);
(c) charging the ledger more per burn — fails because seal-crossing
resets are fuel-indexed, not S-indexed, so no Γ-computable `kcap`
covers chains-of-seals; (d) box-proof continuation interfaces —
circular.  The residual mathematical content: chains restarted inside
a seal revisit jump goals whose pending slots are outside the box, so
the pigeonhole cannot close them; empirically budgets stabilise at
`b ≈ 2–3` regardless (probe battery, `wip/v3probe*.lean`), so this
statement is believed true — it is exactly the one-step budget
stabilisation at low budget, the open frontier of the development.

Direct semantic adjudication of THIS statement (2026-07-11, session
scratchpad, `v3probe2`'s 7-algebra zoo on the real `itpA`/`itpE`):
zero counterexample points on two adversarial defect-1 configurations
— `S = {◯p⊃r, r}`, `Γ = [◯p⊃r]` (J = 2), and the shared-consequent
pair `S = {◯p⊃r, ◯p₂⊃r, r}` (J = 4, the shape whose live-jump-goal
count exceeds every defect bound, i.e. the worst case for any
defect-indexed ledger) — across goal shapes `p`, `◯p`, `p⊃r`, `◯r`,
`◯(◯p∧r)`, `◯r⊃p` and eliminated atoms absent/live/consequent, at
budgets both in the open band and far below the floor (`c = 1, 2`).
A refutation would have voided the design; none was found.  (The
kernel decider was also pointed at the smallest instance and killed
at a 20-minute cap — its search space is infeasible even there, as
`HANDOFF.md` warns; the zoo is the effective adjudicator.)
The `defect S Γ = 0` band is settled (`cascade_zero` above: every
space-guarded clause is dead and the plain fuel induction closes), so
this statement now carries `1 ≤ defect S Γ` — the open band only.

Two structural leads adjudicated 2026-07-11 (evening):

* **Piece-closure kills the fourth site — but only for closed `S`.**
  If `S` is subformula-closed, a goal-membership invariant `g ∈ S`
  threads through every recursion of `cascade_main` (entry goals are
  antecedent/body pieces of `S`-clauses; decomposition, `C₂`,
  γ-unboxing and carried goals preserve it), and then a fresh goal
  antecedent outside `S` is impossible — the fresh-antecedent seal is
  dead code.  This CANNOT be used here: the three interface lemmas
  quantify over arbitrary `S`, and for non-closed `S` the site is
  reachable at depth 0 (goal `A₁⊃B₁` with `A₁ ∉ Γ ∪ S`).  The
  downstream adequacy instantiation uses the piece-closed space, so a
  closed-`S` variant of this lemma would face only the three ◯-seals;
  recorded for the consumer, not usable for the ∀`S` statements.
* **The ◯-goal specialization is a circular reduction.**  Landing the
  target's truncation disjunct keeps the goal ◯-shaped through every
  box (laxL/`box_fire` need no fresh seen-allotment for the crossing
  itself), and the collapse+re-import moves reduce the γ-family seals
  to: inner descents at strictly smaller goals (weight-paying),
  pointwise `others`-maps (fuel-paying), and the jump-env first
  components at `(c → c−1)` — which are again pair descents at
  arbitrary-shaped jump goals at burned room, i.e. THIS statement one
  budget down.  No measure decreases across that residue (jump goals
  reset weight and ◯-depth; `c` burns without pigeonhole room), so
  the specialization re-derives what the seen-machinery already gives
  above the threshold and cannot close the band below it.

Guarded/consumed reshaping campaign (2026-07-12; zoo file
`wip/refute4.lean` — 34-pair exhaustive-nuclei zoo; engines
`box_remap`/`box_reguard` above).  The task-#13 transfer hypothesis
(guardMP's consumed form admissible where retained fails; Pitts'
guarded `L4→` provable where Iemhoff's unguarded needs cut) was
adjudicated against these seals.  Verdict — the analogy breaks for an
identified structural reason, and the obstruction is now sharper:

* **What crosses a seal is machine-delimited** (`box_remap`): the
  inner obligation receives the opened source body, the target
  guard, and the ENTIRE outer context — every formula-shaped
  resource crosses (laxL retains contexts); only the seen-set
  continuations (meta-level, concluding the outer `R`) do not.
  Guarded-engine candidates therefore repackage the same inner
  sequent.  At same-context seals every reachable guard is
  budget-mono-DOMINATED by the ambient (`E@(c+1) ⊢ E@c ⊢ E@(c−1)`
  pointwise): machine-checked by Z6 ≡ Z1 at the failing point.
  `box_reguard` (Z2b) is the (A)-family survivor — guard plumbing
  with the ambient outside the box; it leaves the value map intact.
* **The floor is a ledger artifact on the A-side** (Z1): the BARE
  descent with only `1 ≤ c` is zoo-true at every probed
  configuration and budget `c ≥ 1` — defect 1 and 2, J ∈ {1,2,4},
  chained (`S={◯p⊃r,r,◯r⊃s,s}`, floor 12) and shared-consequent
  (`S={◯p⊃r,◯p₂⊃r,r}`, floor 6) jump structures, mostly with zero
  slack — and zoo-FALSE at exactly the structural point
  (◯-shaped goal, `c = 0`), where the target table is empty (goal
  clause and truncation both b-gated: `A@0(Γ,◯D) = ⊥` — literally,
  since `orAll [] = ⊥`).
* **But the E-mate genuinely fails low** (Z8): the floorless ascent
  `E@c ⊢ E@(c+1)` is zoo-REFUTED at (chained-d2, `c = 1`) — witness
  chain3, nucleus `[0,2,2]`, `v(r)=v(s)=1` — while true at `c ≥ 2`
  there.  So the mutual-pair decomposition (the only known proof
  scheme) is closed off below `c = 2` by countermodel, independent
  of the seal problem; the A-band's truth at `c = 1` does not
  decompose through the pair.
* **Why the Pitts/guardMP analogy breaks**: her guards are
  ANTECEDENT-side — weakening carries hypotheses across any commit,
  which is exactly why consumed forms close.  The seal deficit is
  SUCCEDENT-side-under-◯: continuations are conclusion-anchored
  (they conclude the outer disjunction `R`, strictly weaker than
  the single ◯-disjunct a seal must produce), and formula-shaped
  stand-ins fail — in-context oracles `(value ⇢ R)` fire to the
  wrong conclusion inside a seal, and budget-family oracles
  `⋀_{β≤c}(A@(β+1) ⇢ A@β)` are the stabilization ladder itself.
  Ledger-raising cannot compensate: entry `… + X` funds seals to
  `defect·(J+2)+X ≤ c−1` while the raised holdout would need
  `J+1+defect·(J+2)+X ≤ c−1` — short by `J+1` for every `X`.
* **The fresh-antecedent seal's law is semantically FREE** (Z5):
  `E@(c+1)(Γ) ⊓ E@c(C₁::Γ) = E@(c+1)(C₁::Γ)` with EQUALITY on the
  zoo at every probed instance (`C₁ ∈ {u, u⊃r, ◯u}`, at and below
  the floor, including the moving-E chained-d2 config where the
  bare E-ascent fails).  A proof of Z5 would kill the fourth seal (the one
  with no decreasing measure) without the whole-head rebuild; its
  γ-conjunct conversions recurse into the A-descent at `c−1`, i.e.
  into this statement — same knot, but now with a zoo-true target.
* **Identified residue** (the sharpest known formulation): a
  low-band A-lemma — this statement's conclusion from `1 ≤ c` alone
  — is TRUE on the zoo; the known decompositions cannot reach it
  (chains hit the (◯-goal, 0) false point; the E-mate fails at 1;
  continuations cannot cross seals).  The mechanism the semantics
  uses at `c = 1` is SYNTACTIC starvation: b-gated tables at
  saturated/grown contexts collapse to literal `⊥` (`orAll [] = ⊥`),
  e.g. `A@1(Γ,p) ⊢ ⊥` at the canonical config, killing every pair
  disjunct whose partner starves.  A future development would prove
  starvation-collapse lemmas (which `(Γ, g, b)` starve) plus a
  `(defect, budget)`-lex landing map for the `c = 1` base, meeting
  the pigeonhole band from below — cascade_main-scale work, not
  attempted here. -/

The two composite shapes both halves actually land on, reduced to the
interface above.  `Δ`-parametric so the same consumer serves the
E-half (ambient = the source value itself) and the A-half (ambient
stepped down from the `b`-level hypothesis by `itp_budget_mono_le`). -/

target-side guard implication and the packaged ambient, the
