# The gap antichain has NO greatest lower bound — the ∃-side floor question, settled

**Everything here is PLL.**  The question: does the landing ideal

    L := { χ : atomFree χ,  ∀ k ≥ 1, χ ⊢ g k }

(the variable-free common lower bounds of the gap antichain) contain a
formula valid on the plain ladder — equivalently, is the meet of the
antichain attained?  Answer: **NO**, and much more sharply.

The mechanism has three parts.

**(1) Below-edge agreement** (`cmE_agree_below`).  The edged lift
`cmE m` differs from the plain lift only in the two extra `Rₘ`-edges
LEAVING world `m+3`.  A world `y ≤ m+2` never sees `m+3` in its
intuitionistic cone (`cone y ⊆ [0,y]`), so by induction on the formula
the two models force exactly the same formulas at every such world.

**(2) Trace dichotomy** (`plain_trace_dichotomy`).  Forcing is
hereditary along `Rᵢ`, and the cone of `some x` on the ladder is
`{x} ∪ [0, x−2]`; so an unbounded truth set is downward-absorbing and
must be ALL of ℕ.  Every formula's plain-ladder trace is therefore
either everything or bounded.

**(3) Edge stability** (`edge_stability`).  For every formula `φ` there
is `M(φ)` with

    ∀ m ≥ M(φ),   (cmE m, m+3) ⊨ φ  ↔  (ladder, m+3) ⊨ φ.

Induction on `φ`: atoms and `⊥` are false at every skeleton world in
both models; `∧`,`∨`,`⊃` combine (the `⊃`-clause splits its cone into
`m+3`, where the IH applies, and `[0,m+1]`, where (1) applies); and the
`◯`-clause is where the edge lives —

    (cmE m, m+3) ⊨ ◯N  ↔  ∀ y ∈ [1, m+1], (ladder, y) ⊨ N
    (ladder, m+3) ⊨ ◯N  ↔  (∀ y ∈ [1, m+1], (ladder, y) ⊨ N) ∧ (ladder, m+3) ⊨ N

so the two differ only by the last conjunct, and (2) kills the
difference for `m` past `N`'s trace bound (either `N` is ladder-valid,
when both hold, or `N` fails at some `B+1 ≤ m+1`, when both fail).
Note this needs the trace dichotomy for `N`, NOT the IH for `N`.

**The theorem** (`L_bounded`).  If `χ ⊢ g k` for every `k ≥ 1` then
`χ`'s plain-ladder trace is bounded.  Indeed `g (m+1)` fails at
`(cmE m, m+3)` (`gap_fails`), so by soundness `χ` fails there for
EVERY `m`; were `χ`'s trace unbounded it would be everything, so `χ`
would hold at `(ladder, m+3)` for every `m` — contradicting edge
stability at `m = M(χ)`.  No `atomFree` hypothesis is needed: the two
lifts interpret every atom as the fallible singleton, so the statement
holds for one-variable formulas too.

**Consequences.**

* `no_ladder_valid_lower_bound`: no lower bound of the antichain is
  valid on the plain ladder — while every `g k` IS (`plain_forces_gap`).
* `gap_meet_not_attained`: for every lower bound `χ` and every `N`
  there is a world `n ≥ N` forcing every gap but not `χ`.
* `no_lower_bound_above_odd_rungs`: no lower bound sits above cofinally
  many odd rungs.

**The floor does not exist.**  Generalising the `w15` mechanism
(`Wit_below_all_gaps`) gives, for every `b`, a variable-free lower
bound

    Wit b := (g 1 ∧ … ∧ g (b+1)) ∧ t(2b+6)

whose plain trace contains `b+3`.  Since a greatest lower bound would
have to sit above every `Wit b`, its trace would be unbounded — refuted
by `L_bounded`.  Hence `gap_no_glb`: the family `{ g k : k ≥ 1 }` has
NO greatest lower bound in PLL, variable-free or otherwise; the
descending meet-chain `Gmeet` of `wip/uiObstruct.lean` has no floor.

The two derivation lemmas behind `Wit` are of independent interest and
generalise `w15_below_all_gaps` off its `a = 2` instance:

* `even_rung_gap`: `t(2a+2) ⊢ g k` for every `k ≥ a+1` — the exact
  rung-order threshold;
* `wC_gap_step`: `wC (j+1) = g (j+1) ∧ t(2j+6) ⊢ g (j+2)` — the box
  descent, which buys the one level `k = a` that rung order misses.
