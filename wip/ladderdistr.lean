# Distribution is NOT free on the ladder image

`rnSub_derivU_iff_deriv` says PCLL proves no `rnSub i ⊢ rnSub j` that
PLL does not.  That is a statement about a *rung premise and a rung
conclusion*, and it does not extend to formulas built from rungs.  This
file exhibits the gap: an instance of the distribution axiom

    ◯(A ∨ B) ⊃ (◯A ∨ ◯B)

at rung arguments `A = rnSub 4`, `B = rnSub 3` which is derivable in
PCLL (it is an axiom instance) and **not** derivable in PLL.

## The countermodel

`wip/rnSep.lean` already contains it, as the certificate for
`sep_9_12 : ¬ Interd q9 q12`.  It has FIVE worlds, which is why the
searcher's default battery — all well-formed frames up to four worlds —
reports `?` here however long it is run: the refutation is out of its
range, and the positive stage cannot find a proof because there is
none.

The instance reduces to `q12 ⊢ q9` through the identifications
certified in `wip/ladderfast_out.txt`, but nothing below depends on
that reduction: the model is checked against the literal formula.

/-- **Distribution at rungs 4 and 3 is not PLL-derivable.**

Spelled out, the underivable formula is

    ◯( ((◯⊥ ∨ ¬◯⊥) ⊃ ◯⊥) ∨ (◯⊥ ∨ ¬◯⊥) )
      ⊃ ( ◯((◯⊥ ∨ ¬◯⊥) ⊃ ◯⊥) ∨ ◯(◯⊥ ∨ ¬◯⊥) )

and it is an instance of the PCLL axiom, so PCLL ⊋ PLL already on
formulas built from two rungs. -/
