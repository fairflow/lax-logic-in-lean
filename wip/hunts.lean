# The two hunts, instantiated: the chains are armed

`LaxLogic/PLLUIChains.lean` proves the two refutation criteria generically.
This file instantiates them with the repository's mechanised chains, so that
each hunt is reduced to exactly its two remaining obligations about a witness
formula `φ`.

* **∀p side**: the ascending chain is `chainF k = ◯t(2k+1)`, strictness
  `chain_lt_strict` (`wip/chainStrict.lean`).
* **∃p side**: the descending chain is `Gmeet n` (the gap partial meets),
  strictness proved HERE (`Gmeet_strict`) from the `cmE` machinery of
  `wip/gapWidth.lean` — a fact the floor campaign never needed to pin.

`P` is instantiated at `NoFall.VarFree` (closed = variable-free), which at one
propositional variable is exactly `p`-freeness.  Closedness of the chain
members is proved via a substitution lemma: `embed = substP pv ◯⊥` produces a
variable-free formula whenever the argument mentions at most `pv`.

/-! ## The armed criteria -/

/-- **The ∃p hunt, armed.**  A witness `φ` now needs exactly two facts:
it lies below every `Gmeet n`, and its variable-free consequences are trapped
above the chain.  Given those, `φ` has NO least variable-free consequence —
no post-interpolant — and uniform interpolation fails at one variable. -/
theorem no_existsP_of_trap (φ : PLLFormula)
    (hbelow : ∀ n, Deriv [φ] (Gmeet n))
    (htrap : ∀ ψ, VarFree ψ → Deriv [φ] ψ → ∃ n, Deriv [Gmeet n] ψ) :
    ¬ ∃ χ, VarFree χ ∧ Deriv [φ] χ ∧
        (∀ ψ, VarFree ψ → Deriv [φ] ψ → Deriv [χ] ψ) :=
  no_least_consequence VarFree Gmeet varFree_Gmeet Gmeet_strict φ hbelow htrap

/-- **The ∀p hunt, armed.**  A witness `φ` now needs exactly two facts:
every `chainF k` entails it, and every variable-free formula entailing it sits
below some `chainF k`.  Given those, `φ` has NO greatest variable-free
antecedent — no pre-interpolant. -/
theorem no_forallP_of_trap (φ : PLLFormula)
    (habove : ∀ k, Deriv [chainF k] φ)
    (htrap : ∀ ψ, VarFree ψ → Deriv [ψ] φ → ∃ k, Deriv [ψ] (chainF k)) :
    ¬ ∃ χ, VarFree χ ∧ Deriv [χ] φ ∧
        (∀ ψ, VarFree ψ → Deriv [ψ] φ → Deriv [ψ] χ) :=
  no_greatest_antecedent VarFree chainF varFree_chainF
    (fun k => chain_step_strict k) φ habove htrap

/-! ## Both hunts, as armed, are VACUOUS — neither witness can exist

Before searching for a witness `φ`, check whether one COULD exist. It cannot,
on either side, and the reason is a pair of "collapse" theorems the earlier
campaign already proved for a different purpose (`wip/collapse.lean`,
`wip/rungbound.lean`): a formula pulled all the way to the bottom of the gap
chain collapses onto a single rung; a formula pulled all the way to the top of
the `chainF` chain collapses onto an outright THEOREM. Both collapses hand
back a trivial witness that breaks the trap condition immediately.

## The `∃p` side: `post_interp_exists` already IS the refutation of the trap

`collapse` (`hg : ∀k≥1, φ⊢gap k → ∃m, φ⊢rnSub m`) gives `post_interp_exists`:
every gap-entailing `φ` has a CLOSED consequence `ψ` that ITSELF entails every
gap. That `ψ` is exactly what breaks `htrap`: `htrap` would need
`Gmeet n ⊢ ψ` for some `n`, but `ψ` entailing every gap means `ψ ⊢ Gmeet n`
for ALL `n` (via `gmeet_of_hg`) — in particular `ψ ⊢ Gmeet (n+1)` — so
`Gmeet n ⊢ ψ ⊢ Gmeet (n+1)` gives `Gmeet n ⊢ Gmeet (n+1)`, contradicting
`Gmeet_strict`. So `htrap` can NEVER hold together with `hbelow`: the two
premises of `no_existsP_of_trap` are jointly unsatisfiable. -/

/-- `atomFree` (Bool) and `VarFree` (Prop) are the same notion; the bridge is
a structural induction. -/
theorem varFree_of_atomFree : ∀ (A : PLLFormula),
    LaxInfinite.atomFree A = true → VarFree A
  | .prop _, h => by simp [LaxInfinite.atomFree] at h
  | .falsePLL, _ => trivial
  | .and a b, h => by
      simp only [LaxInfinite.atomFree, Bool.and_eq_true] at h
      exact ⟨varFree_of_atomFree a h.1, varFree_of_atomFree b h.2⟩
  | .or a b, h => by
      simp only [LaxInfinite.atomFree, Bool.and_eq_true] at h
      exact ⟨varFree_of_atomFree a h.1, varFree_of_atomFree b h.2⟩
  | .ifThen a b, h => by
      simp only [LaxInfinite.atomFree, Bool.and_eq_true] at h
      exact ⟨varFree_of_atomFree a h.1, varFree_of_atomFree b h.2⟩
  | .somehow a, h => varFree_of_atomFree a h

/-- `hbelow`'s shape converts to `collapse`'s `hg` shape. -/
theorem hbelow_to_hg {φ : PLLFormula} (hbelow : ∀ n, Deriv [φ] (Gmeet n)) :
    ∀ k, 1 ≤ k → Deriv [φ] (gap k) := by
  intro k hk
  exact Deriv.cutHead (hbelow (k - 1))
    ((show k - 1 + 1 = k from by omega) ▸ Gmeet_proj (k - 1) k hk (by omega))

/-- **The `∃p` trap is UNSATISFIABLE.**  No `φ` can ever meet both premises
of `no_existsP_of_trap` at once, so the hunt via `Gmeet` is closed — not by
exhausting candidates, but by showing none can exist. This is the same fact
the earlier campaign proved as `post_interp_schema_vacuous`
(`wip/collapse.lean`), reached here as a direct corollary of
`no_existsP_of_trap`'s own hypotheses. -/
theorem existsP_trap_unsatisfiable :
    ¬ ∃ φ : PLLFormula, (∀ n, Deriv [φ] (Gmeet n)) ∧
        (∀ ψ, VarFree ψ → Deriv [φ] ψ → ∃ n, Deriv [Gmeet n] ψ) := by
  rintro ⟨φ, hbelow, htrap⟩
  have hg := hbelow_to_hg hbelow
  obtain ⟨ψ, hψVF, hψgap, hψφ⟩ := post_interp_exists hg
  obtain ⟨n, hn⟩ := htrap ψ (varFree_of_atomFree ψ hψVF) hψφ
  exact Gmeet_strict n (Deriv.cutHead hn (gmeet_of_hg hψgap (n + 1)))

/-! ## The `∀p` side: `c_chain_bound_is_theorem` is the mirror collapse

`c_chain_bound_is_theorem` (`hc : ∀k, chainF k ⊢ φ → ⊢ φ`) says a formula
entailed from EVERY level of the ascending chain is an outright theorem. Then
`⊤` is a closed formula with `⊢ φ` (weakening the empty-context proof), so
`htrap` would need `⊤ ⊢ chainF k` for some `k` — i.e. `chainF k` itself a
theorem. It never is: `chain_step_strict k` already forbids it (a theorem
weakens into `Deriv [chainF (k+1)] (chainF k)`, contradicting strictness
directly). So `htrap` can never hold together with `habove` either. -/

/-- No `chainF k` is a theorem — a one-line consequence of `chain_step_strict`
via weakening, no new semantic content needed. -/
theorem chainF_not_theorem (k : Nat) : [] ⊬ chainF k := by
  rintro ⟨d⟩
  exact chain_step_strict k ⟨d.rename (fun _ h => by cases h)⟩

/-- **The `∀p` trap is UNSATISFIABLE.**  No `φ` can ever meet both premises of
`no_forallP_of_trap` at once, so the hunt via `chainF` is closed the same way —
the mirror of `existsP_trap_unsatisfiable`, and the same fact the earlier
campaign proved as `pre_interp_schema_vacuous` (`wip/rungbound.lean`). -/
theorem forallP_trap_unsatisfiable :
    ¬ ∃ φ : PLLFormula, (∀ k, Deriv [chainF k] φ) ∧
        (∀ ψ, VarFree ψ → Deriv [ψ] φ → ∃ k, Deriv [ψ] (chainF k)) := by
