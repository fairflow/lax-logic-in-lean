# THE FRONTIER SAMPLER — PLL instantiation

`wip/frontierCore.lean` is the generic layer (strata, admissibility gate,
corpus, replay); this file instantiates it at the tower's live obligation.

## What it screens

Two statements, one sequent.  Both are the `◯`-goal descent

    E@(ft, b+1)(Γ)  ,  A@(fs, b+1)(Γ, ◯D)   ⟹   A@(ft, b)(Γ, ◯D)

and they differ only in their **side conditions**:

* `cascade_boxgoal_pos` (`wip/absorb_base.lean`:2269, the tower's one `sorry`)
  carries the ROOM `defect S Γ · (|jumpGoals S| + 2) ≤ b`.  A refutation at a
  room-carrying cell re-opens the STATEMENT.
* `Round4.BoxDesc` (`wip/round4Comp.lean`:101) is room-free: only `1 ≤ b` and
  `fs ≤ ft`.  It is what PROGRESS §61(c) alternative 1 and the round-6/7
  prove route need.  A refutation at any admissible cell, including a
  SUB-ROOM one, kills that route.

So a single screen of `[src, amb] ⊢ tgt` settles both, and the cell's
recorded `stmt` column says which statement it is admissible for:
`both` when the room holds, `boxdesc` when `1 ≤ b < room`.

## Why a sampler and not another sweep

PROGRESS §§59–63 screened by exhaustive sweeps over small bounded regions,
re-scoped per formula of interest as each arose.  The shape that mattered in
round 6 — a space containing a doubly-boxed γ-clause `◯◯E ⊃ B`, witness
`S3` = piece-closure of `◯◯(a⊃b) ⊃ c` — sits one `◯`-nesting level beyond
the swept region and was found proof-side, two rounds after a
depth-stratified sample would have flagged the family.  This harness samples
sparsely and BROADLY along the axes the tables branch on, one structural
level beyond current use.

## The rules of the screen

* **Countermodel-only.**  `PLLND.Search.refute?` with `emitClosureCap := 0`
  runs the certified frame battery and nothing else: no proof search, no
  exponential closure emitter.  Every verdict is a kernel-checkable
  `FinCM.checkB` certificate or silence.  Countermodel CHECKING is cheap;
  proof SEARCH is not, and it is not this harness's job.
* **A quiet cell is quiet.**  `quiet` is recorded, never escalated and never
  reported as a positive result.  Escalation is a separate, statement-driven
  decision.
* **Never count an inadmissible cell.**  The six gates below are machine
  checks on the generated instance; a cell failing any of them is written to
  the corpus as `gate=FAIL:…` and excluded from every count.

`Plausible.Gen` supplies the generator combinators; `runSeeded` is the pure,
explicitly seeded runner.  `Plausible.Gen.run` is NOT used anywhere: it draws
from the global `stdGenRef` and is therefore not reproducible. -/

/-- **Seed diffusion.**  `Plausible.runRandWith` feeds the seed to
`mkStdGen`, whose first draws on nearby seeds are strongly correlated: the
pilot run drew the same γ-clause `(◯c) ⊃ a` from seeds `1000, 1009, 1017`.
One splitmix64 step before the seed reaches `mkStdGen` decorrelates it, and
the campaign stays exactly as reproducible (the mixing is a pure function of
the recorded seed). -/

/-! ## §4  The cell grid

One base instance yields up to nine cells: three budgets — the room floor,
one below it, and `1` — crossed with three fuel pairs.  `b = room` screens
BOTH statements; `b < room` screens `Round4.BoxDesc` only. -/

def Cell.J (c : Cell) : Nat := (jumpGoals c.S).card
def Cell.room (c : Cell) : Nat := c.defect * (c.J + 2)

/-- **The fuel ceiling.**  The tables grow super-exponentially in the fuel:
at `|S| = 8` a cell at `ft = 5` weighs ~17 000 and its battery sweep costs
~12 s, while `ft = 4` is under a second.  Every fuel pair of the grid has
`ft = b + 1`, so this is equivalently a budget ceiling `b ≤ ftCap - 1`.

Consequence, recorded rather than hidden: a stratum whose room exceeds
`ftCap - 1` (defect ≥ 2, or `J ≥ 3`) contributes only SUB-ROOM cells, which
screen `Round4.BoxDesc` and not `cascade_boxgoal_pos`.  PROGRESS §62 reached

forces fuel ≥ 7)" were screened not at all). -/

/-! ### The two-stage size guard

Building `src`/`amb`/`tgt` is itself expensive when the cell is large — the
profile pass sees cells of weight 750 000 — so the weight cannot be the FIRST
test.  Stage 1 is a purely syntactic predictor: the tables recurse once per
live growth clause per fuel level, so `ft · (1 + liveGates)` tracks the
blow-up closely.  Measured against the profile: at `ft = 5`, one live gate
gives weights in the hundreds and two gives weights in the hundred
thousands.  Stage 2 is the actual weight against `szCap`.

Both stages record their reason in the corpus, so a cell that was never run
is visible as such and is never counted as quiet. -/

/-! ### Campaign-2 strata — the `J = 1` band, where the room-carrying
statement is actually reachable

Campaign 1 measured something the exhaustive sweeps could not: of 692
screened cells, only **12** were simultaneously admissible for
`cascade_boxgoal_pos` (room `≤ b`) and budget-ACTIVE, and all twelve were in
`j1-nogamma`.  The reason is arithmetic: any γ-clause `◯X ⊃ B` contributes
BOTH `X` and `◯X` to `jumpGoals`, so `J ≥ 2`, so the room is `≥ 4`, so the
room-carrying cells sit at `b = 4`, `ft = 5`, where the tables weigh
10⁵–10⁶ and are not decide-feasible.  `J = 1` — a jump clause and no
γ-clause — has room `3`, and its room-carrying cells are small.

These four strata put the nested-box GOAL shapes into that reachable band.
`jb1-nbox` is a randomised generalisation of PROGRESS §62's three residual
`JB2` cells (`D = ◯((a⊃b)⊃c)`, room 3, `b = 3`); `jb1-nbox2` is one `◯`
beyond them. -/

/-! ### Round-8 strata — the §66(h) residue shape

`CompProd`'s goal-row case at jump-shaped UNBOXED bodies over a γ-carrying
space: `D = (x⊃y)⊃z` with `goalBoxDepth = 0`, a γ-clause present so the
walk's γ-tier is live.  A genuinely jump-shaped `D` needs `jumpExtra` (the
γ-seed's own closure contains no jump-shaped member, so without it the
generator falls back — `d1-jump`'s recorded `D` is the γ-clause itself).
The γ-clause plus the jump clause force `J ≥ 3`, so every cell here is
SUB-room: the standard triage screens the room-free `Round4.BoxDesc`
(a hit kills it outright), and the `wip/frontier_g8.lean` passes re-drive
the same cells at the round-8 goal-row sequents (`c < b`), where a hit is
a `CompProd`-level result (`Round7.not_boxDesc_of_not_compProd`). -/

/-! ### Replay

A cell is a pure function of `(stratum, seed, size)`, so the corpus can be
re-driven with no regeneration guesswork.  Two uses are implemented:

* `replayRegression` — regenerate every recorded admissible cell and check
  that its shape columns still match the corpus.  This is the determinism
  audit: if it disagrees, the generator or the instruments moved under the
  corpus and every stored verdict is suspect.
* `replayUnboxed` — screen a DIFFERENT statement over the same instances:
  the room-free descent at the UNBOXED goal `D` in place of `◯D`.  That
  statement is known false (`AscRefute.not_roomFreeDescent`,
  `Round4Probe3.unboxed_refuted`), so the corpus should produce hits; how
  many, and where, measures how load-bearing the `◯` is across the sampled
  region rather than at the single instance §60 checked. -/
