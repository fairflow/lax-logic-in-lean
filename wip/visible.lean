# Visibility: join-prime elements of the closed lax fragment RN(◯,{})

For a Heyting algebra `H` the principal filter `↑a = {x | a ≤ x}` is a PRIME
filter exactly when `a` is JOIN-PRIME,

    a ≤ x ⊔ y  ⟹  a ≤ x  or  a ≤ y,

and the prime filters are the points of the Esakia dual.  In the Lindenbaum
algebra of the closed (variable-free) fragment of PLL, with `≤` given by
single-hypothesis derivability, this reads

    ∀ x y closed,  ⊢ a ⊃ (x ∨ y)  ⟹  ⊢ a ⊃ x  or  ⊢ a ⊃ y

— the DISJUNCTION PROPERTY RELATIVE TO `a`.  A proof of it, together with
`a ⊬ ⊥` (properness of `↑a`), is a proof that `a` names a point of the dual.
This file calls that predicate `Visible`.

## What is proved here

* `primeAll_top` / `visible_top` — the top element `⊤` is join-prime.  This is
  literally F&M Lemma 2.7(i), `PLLSequent.disjunction_property`: join-primality
  of `⊤` and the disjunction property ARE the same statement, and `↑⊤` is the
  least point of the dual, the root world forcing exactly the theorems.

* `harrop_sc` / `harrop_dp` — **the Harrop lemma for PLL**:

      every `φ ∈ Γ` Harrop  and  Γ ⊢ x ∨ y   ⟹   Γ ⊢ x  or  Γ ⊢ y

  proved by induction on the height of a cut-free `SCh` derivation
  (`PLLSequent.cutElimination` supplies the cut-free derivation, and the
  last-rule inspection follows `disjunction_property` as template).

* `primeAll_of_harrop` — a Harrop formula is join-prime; `PrimeAll.of_interd` —
  join-primality is invariant under interderivability, so it is a property of
  the Lindenbaum CLASS, and a Harrop REPRESENTATIVE suffices.

* Instantiation at the embedded Rieger–Nishimura ladder `t n := rnSub n`
  (`rnEmbed.lean`: `rn n` with `p := ◯⊥`):
  `visible_rnSub_one` (`t1 = ◯⊥`), `visible_rnSub_two` (`t2 = ¬◯⊥`),
  `visible_rnSub_four` (`t4 = (◯⊥ ∨ ¬◯⊥) ⊃ ◯⊥`), and — beyond the reach of
  Harrop applied to `t6` itself — `visible_rnSub_six`, via
  `rnSub_six_interd : t6 ≡ ¬¬◯⊥ ⊃ ◯⊥`, whose right-hand side IS Harrop.

* `not_joinPrime_rnSub_odd` — a REFUTATION: every odd rung `t (2k+3)` fails
  join-primality, since `t (2k+3) = t (2k+1) ∨ t (2k+2)` syntactically while
  neither disjunct is entailed (`rnSub_deriv_iff`).  So the odd rungs from `t3`
  on are proper joins, not points.

* `visible_gap_zero` / `harrop_gap_succ` — the gap family
  `g k = ◯ t (2k+1) ⊃ t (2k+1)`: `g 0` is visible but degenerate (`g 0 ⊣⊢ ⊤`),
  and from `k = 1` on the criterion does not apply.  Those gaps are OPEN.

* `joinPrime_of_exactRooted` — the semantic route, in general form: an EXACT
  ROOTED MODEL for `a` (a pointed model forcing `a` whose closed theory is
  exactly the closed consequences of `a`) makes `a` join-prime immediately, by
  locality of the Kripke `∨` clause.  `rnSub_even_prime_on_rungs` runs that
  route as far as the available exactness reaches: every EVEN rung is prime
  against RUNG-SHAPED disjunctions, because its ladder truth set is the
  principal upset `↑(k+1)`.  The obstruction to the full statement is recorded
  in the docstring of `rnSub_even_prime_on_rungs`.

## How `◯` is treated in the Harrop predicate

`Harrop (◯A) = true` for **arbitrary** `A` — not only for Harrop `A`.  This was
not assumed but read off the calculus.  The lax left rule of `PLLSequent.SCh` is

      Γ, A ⊢ ◯B
    -------------- ◯L        (principal `◯A ∈ Γ`, kept)
      Γ ⊢ ◯B

and it carries a SUCCEDENT RESTRICTION: its conclusion must be a `◯`-formula.
Along the whole induction of `harrop_sc` the succedent stays the disjunction
`x ∨ y`, so `◯L` is never applicable and a hypothesis `◯A` generates NO case at
all — `cases` on the derivation discards it by unification.  Hence `◯A` is inert
on the left for this argument whatever `A` is, and `◯(x ∨ y)` counts as Harrop
even though `x ∨ y` does not.  This is a point where PLL behaves BETTER than the
IPC analogy would suggest, and it is what makes `t1 = ◯⊥` and
`t4 = (◯⊥ ∨ ¬◯⊥) ⊃ ◯⊥` immediate.

The other clauses are the classical ones: `A ∧ B` Harrop when both are (`andL`
puts both components in the context), `C ⊃ B` Harrop when `B` is, with `C`
ARBITRARY (`impL` puts only `B` in the context of the minor premise, and the
major premise `Γ ⊢ C` is carried unexamined), and no disjunction is Harrop
(`orL` must be blocked outright).

`Harrop φ` says: no `∨` occurs in a strictly positive position of `φ`.  Atoms
and `⊥` are Harrop; `A ∧ B` is Harrop when both are; `C ⊃ B` is Harrop when `B`
is, with `C` ARBITRARY; and `◯A` is Harrop for `A` ARBITRARY — see the header
for why the calculus forces the last clause. -/

/-- **The Harrop lemma, cut-free form.**  If every hypothesis is Harrop then a
cut-free derivation of a disjunction yields a derivation of a disjunct:

    (∀ φ ∈ Γ, Harrop φ)  →  SCh n Γ (x ∨ y)  →  SC Γ x  or  SC Γ y.

Induction on the height `n`.  The succedent stays `x ∨ y` throughout, so the
only rules that can end the derivation are `botL`, `andL`, `orL`, `impL`,
`orR1`, `orR2`; `orL` is impossible (no Harrop formula is a disjunction),
`andL`/`impL` reproduce the Harrop hypothesis on their minor premise, and
`orR1`/`orR2` deliver the disjunct.  `laxL` cannot fire at all: its conclusion
must be a `◯`-formula. -/

/-! ## The semantic route

An **exact rooted model** for `a` is a pointed model `(M, w)` with

    M, w ⊩ a      and      ∀ closed φ,  M, w ⊩ φ  →  a ⊢ φ.

Join-primality is then immediate from the locality of the Kripke `∨` clause:
soundness sends `a ⊢ x ∨ y` to `M, w ⊩ x ∨ y`, the clause splits it, and
exactness sends the surviving disjunct back. -/

/-- A pointed model whose closed theory is exactly the closed consequences
of `a`. -/
structure ExactRooted (a : PLLFormula) where
  M : ConstraintModel
  w : M.W
  forces : M.force w a
  closedComplete : ∀ φ : PLLFormula, atomFree φ = true → M.force w φ → Deriv [a] φ

/-- **Exactness gives visibility.**  The whole content is the locality of the
`∨` clause: `M, w ⊩ x ∨ y` is `M, w ⊩ x` or `M, w ⊩ y`, with no quantification
over successors. -/

/-- The ladder truth set of an even rung is the PRINCIPAL upset `↑(k+1)`: any
rung true at `k+1` is true everywhere `t (2k+2)` is. -/
theorem even_upset {k m : Nat} (h : ladder.sat (rn m) (k + 1)) :
    ∀ w : Nat, ladder.sat (rn (2 * k + 2)) w → ladder.sat (rn m) w := by

    omega
  · rw [sat_rn_even] at h
    intro w hw
    rw [sat_rn_even] at hw
    rw [sat_rn_even]
    omega

/-- **The semantic route, as far as available exactness reaches.**  Every EVEN
rung is join-prime against RUNG-SHAPED disjunctions:

    t (2k+2) ⊢ t i ∨ t j   ⟹   t (2k+2) ⊢ t i   or   t (2k+2) ⊢ t j.

Proof: soundness through `Skel.transfer` turns the hypothesis into truth-set
containment on the ladder; at the world `k+1`, which forces `t (2k+2)`, one
disjunct must hold; and since the truth set of `t (2k+2)` is the principal
upset `↑(k+1)`, that disjunct is forced wherever `t (2k+2)` is, so
`rnSub_deriv_iff` returns a derivation.

This is NOT full join-primality: the quantifier in `JoinPrime` ranges over ALL
closed `x`, `y`, and `Skel.transfer` controls only formulas in the image of
`embed` on `◯`-free formulas, i.e. the sublattice of RN(◯,{}) generated by
`◯⊥`.  The missing statement is exactly the `closedComplete` field of
`ExactRooted` for the ladder point:

    ∀ φ, atomFree φ = true → ladder.cm.force (some (k+1)) φ → Deriv [rnSub (2k+2)] φ,

i.e. that the ladder model is EXACT for the whole closed fragment.  That is a
completeness theorem about RN(◯,{}), not about the embedded ladder: closed
formulas outside the `◯⊥`-generated sublattice (`◯(¬◯⊥)` is one, by
`LaxInfinite.closed_lax_ge_eight`) are not controlled by `Skel.transfer`.  It
is OPEN here. -/
