# `AmbGuardAscent` is FALSE — the interface refuted, kernel-checked

`wip/cascadeBox.lean` reduces the `◯`-involving low-budget descent to four
interface propositions.  This file refutes the first of them.

`AmbGuardAscent p S` asserts the one-step *ascent* of the existential
quantifier table at a freshly grown context, financed by the ambient table
at the ungrown context:

    Δ ⊢ E@(c+1)(Γ)   ⟹   E@c(X::Γ), Δ ⊢ E@(c+1)(X::Γ)      (X ∈ S, X ∉ Γ)

It was abstracted out of the three paired-implication growth arms, where the
box-free clone had financed the same step from the room-funded existential
half of its mutual pair.  It is **false at the budget floor**: with

    S = {◯p ⊃ r, r, ◯r ⊃ s, s},  Γ = [◯p ⊃ r],  X = ◯r ⊃ s,  c = 1,

the instance fails in the two-world infallible model `0 ⊑ 1`, `0 ⊳ 1` with
`r`, `s` true exactly at world `1` — the Kripke form of the countermodel the
algebraic battery first exhibited (3-chain, nucleus `j(0) = 0`, `j(x) = 2`,
valuation `r = s = 1`).  The failure is stable in the fuel (identical at
fuels 3, 4, 5) and confined to the floor (no failure at budget ≥ 2), which is
the signature of the low-budget wall itself.

**Consequence.**  The three growth arms of `oth_descent` that consume this
interface need a different treatment; the ascent cannot be assumed at the
grown context in the form stated.  What survives untouched: `oth_descent` and
`cascade_box` as *conditional* theorems, and the other three interfaces
(`GammaPairFloorA`, `GammaPairFloorBox`, `JumpPairFloor`), which the battery
supports.  `cascade_box_unconditional` is now known to rest on a false
hypothesis and must not be quoted as evidence for the kernel.

/-! ## 2. The room-free descent itself is false

The build's target statement drops the room hypothesis
`defect S Γ * (|jumpGoals S| + 2) ≤ c` that the tower's kernel carries,
keeping only `1 ≤ c`.  That is too strong: the descent fails at budget `1`
whenever the goal's antecedent is a `⊃◯`-clause, because the antecedent
introduces a budget-gated conjunct at the grown context which the ambient at
the ungrown context cannot finance — the same mechanism as §1, now reaching
the descent itself.

The tower's kernel `cascade_low_pos_box` is **not** touched: with
`1 ≤ defect S Γ` its room hypothesis forces `2 ≤ defect · (|jumpGoals| + 2) ≤ c`,
so its budget-`1` instances are vacuous.  What is refuted is the room-free
reformulation. -/

antecedent is the `⊃◯`-clause `◯r ⊃ s`. -/

    G4c Δ (itpA p S fuel (c + 1) Γ g) →

/-- **The room-free descent is false.**  Hence no proof of the four
interface propositions of `wip/cascadeBox.lean` can exist: `cascade_box`
derives exactly this conclusion from them, at an instance whose
piece-closure side conditions `Sk` satisfies. -/
