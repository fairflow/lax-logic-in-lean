# The gated environment clauses of the descent, above the floor

`wip/goalDesc.lean` removes the goal side of the descent from the problem: a
budget-gated *goal* clause demotes only its existential component, which the
ambient supplies free, so no goal branch ever reaches budget `0`.  The
low-budget difficulty is therefore entirely in the **environment** clauses,
and only in the two budget-gated ones (`itpAenv` rows 7a and 8a of the clause
table): the jump clause `(A⊃B)⊃D ∈ Γ ∩ S` with `B⊃D ∈ Γ`, and the γ-clause
`◯A ⊃ B ∈ Γ ∩ S`.

Each of those contributes disjuncts of the form (first component) ∧ (second
component), where the second component sits at the **grown** context `D::Γ`
or `B::Γ` and the same budget — so the defect tier supplies it — and the
first component sits at the **same** context one budget **lower**.  There are
three first components in all:

| clause | first component of the target at budget `b = c+1` |
|---|---|
| jump | `E@c(Γ) ⇢ A@c(Γ, A⊃B)` |
| γ, plain | `A@c(Γ, A)` |
| γ, boxed | `◯( E@c(Γ) ⇢ A@c(Γ, ◯A) )` |

This file proves **all three** close, at every target budget `b ≥ 2`, from the
descent at the corresponding *jump goal* one budget down.  The key point is
the same one that settled the goal side, and it is worth stating plainly:

> the ambient is at budget `b + 1 = c + 2`, i.e. **two** above the component's
> budget `c`, so downward existential monotonicity alone supplies the guard
> `E@(c+1)(Γ)` needed to fire the source.  No existential *ascent* is
> involved, and the refuted `AmbGuardAscent` is not consumed here at all.

What is consumed is the descent at a jump goal at target budget `c`, and that
needs `c ≥ 1` — i.e. the *target* budget `b = c + 1 ≥ 2`.  So:

* at target budget `b ≥ 2` the three gated environment first components close
  (this file);
* at target budget `b = 1` they need the descent at budget `0`, which is
  proved by search at unboxed atom goals, open at `⊃`-shaped jump goals, and
  **certified false** at boxed goals (`wip/ascprobe.lean`,
  `wip/jumpprobe.lean`).

That last line is the whole residue of the descent, and it is now one
branch at one budget: the **boxed γ first component at target budget 1**.

/-! ## 1. The γ-clause's plain first component

The target component is `A@c(Γ, A)` and the source's is `A@(c+1)(Γ, A)` at the
same context.  So this is the descent at the unboxed jump goal `A`, applied
directly — no plumbing at all.  Recorded for completeness of the table. -/

goal `A⊃B`. -/

/-! ## 3. The γ-clause's boxed first component — the seal, above the floor

    source   ◯( E@(c+1)(Γ)  ⇢  A@(c+1)(Γ, ◯A) )
    target   ◯( E@c(Γ)      ⇢  A@c(Γ, ◯A) )

`box_remap_free` (`wip/starve.lean`) reduces this to two conversions inside
the box: the **guard** `E@c(Γ) ⊢ E@(c+1)(Γ)`, and the **value**
`A@(c+1)(Γ,◯A) ⊢ A@c(Γ,◯A)`.

The guard conversion looks like an ascent — and the bare ascent
`E@c ⊢ E@(c+1)` is refuted at low budget — but it is not needed: the ambient
sits at budget `c + 2`, so `E@(c+1)(Γ)` follows from it by downward
monotonicity, and `box_remap_free` allows the conversion to use the whole
extended context.  The value conversion is the descent at the boxed jump goal
`◯A`, at target budget `c`.

So the sealed branch that `wip/absorb_base.lean`'s residue analysis lists as
unreachable is reachable at every target budget `≥ 2`.  Only `c = 0` — target
budget `1` — is left, and there the value conversion is the certified-false
descent to budget `0` at a boxed goal. -/

/-! ## 4. The three together

`GatedEnvFirst` bundles the three gated environment first components at one
budget step.  The theorem says: the descent at jump goals at target budget `c`
gives all three at target budget `c + 1`.  Composed with `wip/goalDesc.lean`
(the goal side) and `desc_of_oth` (the truncation), the only thing left in the
descent above target budget `1` is the *ungrown* half of the environment
clauses — which is the defect tier, not the budget. -/

/-! ## 5. The floor case: a starved boxed target reduces to `◯⊥`

At target budget `1` the boxed component sits at budget `0`, where a
`◯`-goal's table is its environment table alone (`itpA_obGoal_floor`) and can
be **starved** — literally `⊥` (`itpA_starve_floor`).  When it is, the target
component is `◯( E@0(Γ) ⇢ ⊥ )`, and any derivation of `◯⊥` gives it: `⊥`
implies `E@0(Γ) ⇢ ⊥` outright, and `laxL` carries that under the box.

So at the floor the branch does not need the (refuted) descent to budget `0`
at all — it needs `◯⊥`.  That is a much weaker demand, and on the probed
configuration it is met: `wip/sealprobe2.lean` reports

    A@1(Γ,◯p)  ⊢  ◯⊥      PROVED

for `Γ = [◯p ⊃ r]`, together with `A@0(Γ,◯p) = ⊥`, `A@0(Γ,p) = ⊥` and
`E@0(Γ) = ⊤` — the three starvation facts the route uses.  Whether
`A@b(Γ,◯D) ⊢ ◯⊥` holds generally is the open question; it held there because
the recursion bottomed out in starved states, which is exactly the
propagation argument `wip/starve.lean` was begun for. -/

/-- **A starved boxed target is met by `◯⊥`.**  No descent, and no ascent. -/

  refine G4c.cut hbot (G4c.laxL (.head _) ?_)
  exact G4c.botL (.head _)

/-! ## 6. The case analysis, formalised

`wip/sealRefute.lean` shows the boxed γ-branch at target budget `1` has no
uniform route: each of the three target disjuncts it could aim at is
individually underivable from the branch's hypotheses.  So the branch needs a
case analysis — and there is one available for free that the earlier survey did
not use, because it looked at the source's *first* component and at the target's
disjuncts rather than at the source's *second*.

The second hypothesis is **itself a disjunction**:

    A@1(B::Γ, C)  =  orAll (itpAfull p S F 1 (B::Γ) C)

so `orAll_elim` on it is a case analysis with one case per disjunct of the
grown-context table.  The two refuting models of §87 are consistent with this
reading: in each, which route succeeds is determined by which disjunct of the
second component holds.

The lemma below is that reduction, and it is agnostic about the routes: it says
the branch follows from *any* assignment of a derivation to each disjunct.  It
is stated for the whole branch obligation (not just the boxed disjunct), because
once the case analysis is in place the branch may reach any target disjunct it
likes, differently in different cases — which is exactly what §87 says it must
do. -/

/-- **The branch obligation, reduced to one case per disjunct of the second
component.**  No route is fixed: each case may reach a different target
disjunct. -/
