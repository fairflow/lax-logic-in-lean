# The descent to budget `0` is FALSE, and the budget tier has no base case

`wip/ascRefute.lean` refuted the descent at target budget `1`.  This file
refutes it at target budget `0`, and does so **without a countermodel
search**: the target table is *literally* `⊥` for structural reasons
(`itpA_starve_floor`), so the only semantic fact needed is that the two
hypotheses are jointly consistent.

## Why this matters for the rebuild

`wip/cascadeBox.lean`'s `oth_descent` is a lexicographic induction whose
middle tier is a strong induction on the budget `c`, carrying `1 ≤ c`.
Its three "floor" interfaces (`GammaPairFloorA`, `GammaPairFloorBox`,
`JumpPairFloor`) exist precisely because at `c = 1` that tier has no
recursive call available: the gated environment clauses of the *target*
table at budget `c` put their first component at budget `c − 1`, so the
branch needs the descent at `(c → c−1)`, which at `c = 1` is the descent
to budget `0`.

This file shows that call is not merely unavailable — it is **false**.
Together with `wip/ascRefute.lean` §2 (the descent at target budget `1`
is false) this says the budget tier cannot be given a base case by
raising the floor: a floor at `n` needs the descent at `n − 1`, and both
`n − 1 = 0` and `n − 1 = 1` are refuted.  The recursion has to terminate
on some *other* measure (context growth, or the pigeonhole over jump
goals that `wip/absorb_base.lean`'s `cascade_main` uses), not on the
budget.

## The configuration

    S  = {◯(⊥⊃⊥), ⊥⊃⊥, ⊥}        (piece-closed)
    Γ  = []                        (so every context piece is in S, vacuously)
    g  = ◯(⊥⊃⊥) ∈ S               (a `◯`-shaped goal)

At `Γ = []` the environment table is empty at every budget, so at budget
`0` a `◯`-goal's table is `orAll [] = ⊥` (`itpA_starve_floor`: the goal
clause and the truncation disjunct are both budget-gated).  At budget `1`
the goal clause reappears, and its body is a *theorem* — `⊥∧⊤ ⊃ ⊥` under a
vacuous guard — so the source table is satisfiable.  The descent would
therefore derive `⊥` from consistent hypotheses.

## What it says about the budget law

`Descends` (`wip/descent2.lean`) is the descent with the budget
requirement left as a parameter `need`.  This configuration is an
instance at target budget `0`, so it forces `1 ≤ need S [] g` — at a
space whose *gated-piece count is zero*.  That kills the gate-count
candidate `needGate` a second time, and this time from data rather than
from a proof obligation: `needGate` asks for `0` here, and `0` is not
enough.  The earlier elimination (`needGate_not_floor1`) used the empty
space, which one might dismiss as degenerate; this space is piece-closed
with a genuine `◯`-goal.
