# The semantic route to uniform interpolation for PLL

2026-07-18 · companion to `LaxLogic/PLLSemUI.lean` (compiles; exactly two
`sorry`s = the two named open targets). Status words used precisely:
PROVED = machine-checked in that file today; OPEN = stated with `sorry`;
observations without Lean anchors are marked as such.

**Update 2026-07-19 — see §0 below for the session's results: the
essential-fibre conjecture is PROVED (both image theorems), and
definability acquired a two-generator certificate method (substitution
instances + the lower transform of the doubled model) with a
computational value table at one variable.**

## 0. Results of 2026-07-19 (all machine-checked in `LaxLogic/PLLSemUI.lean`)

**(a) The essential fibre of the quantifiers — the conjecture is a
theorem.**  Call `p` *inessential* in M when M is PLL-equivalent to some
p-free formula (`Inessential`), *essential* otherwise.  The two warm-up
exercises:

    IsSemAll p M ⊤  →  ⊢ M          (semAll_true_derivable)
    IsSemEx  p M ⊥  →  M ⊢ ⊥        (semEx_false_refutes)

so ⊤ is never an essential ∀p-value and ⊥ never an essential ∃p-value.
The full image theorems, for p-free ξ:

    (∃ M, IsSemAll p M ξ ∧ p essential in M)  ⟺  ⊬ ξ
                                       (essential_semAll_image)
    (∃ M, IsSemEx p M ξ ∧ p essential in M)   ⟺  ξ ⊬ ⊥
                                       (essential_semEx_image)

Witnesses: `∀p.(ξ ∨ p) = ξ` and `∃p.(ξ ∧ p) = ξ` (`semAll_or_p`,
`semEx_and_p`); essentiality of the witnesses by separating the
substitution instances `p := ⊤` and `p := ⊥` at the countermodel that
classical completeness extracts from the underivability hypothesis.  On
the closed fragment this reads: **the essential ∀p-image is
RN(◯,{}) ∖ {⊤} and the essential ∃p-image is RN(◯,{}) ∖ {⊥}** —
exactly the conjectured structure theorem.  Concrete instances proved:
⊥, ◯⊥, ¬◯⊥ are essential ∀p-values (`essential_fibre_boxFalse`,
`essential_fibre_neg_boxFalse`), and the original data points carry
essential preimages: `∀p.p = ⊥` with p essential in p
(`essential_prop_self`), `∀p.◯p = ◯⊥` with p essential in ◯p
(`essential_box_p`).

**(b) The certificate method for definability.**  Decorating p by the
truth set of any formula χ is a legal redecoration, and forcing there is
forcing of the substitution instance M[p:=χ] (`force_truthDeco`).  This
yields sound, oracle-checkable criteria:

    ∃-side:  p ∉ atoms ψ,  M ⊢ ψ,  ψ ⊢ M[p:=χ]        ⟹  IsSemEx p M ψ
    ∀-side:  p ∉ atoms ψ,  ψ ⊢ M,  M[p:=χ₁],…,M[p:=χₖ] ⊢ ψ
                                                       ⟹  IsSemAll p M ψ

(`isSemEx_of_certificates`, `isSemAll_of_certificates`).  Every
certificate found by the search oracle is immediately a Lean proof of a
quantifier value.

**(c) The criteria are provably incomplete, and the first repair is the
doubling.**  `∀p.(p ∨ ¬p) = ⊥` (`semAll_em_p`), but every substitution
instance of p ∨ ¬p is an excluded-middle instance, forced at the
one-world classical model — so no finite family of instances derives ⊥
(`em_p_no_certificate`).  The proof instead *doubles* the model
(`double`: two copies stacked along the 2-chain, both relations
monotone into the upper copy; the projection is a total p-bisimulation)
and decorates p on the upper copy only (`emVariant`): a non-fallible
lower world then forces neither p nor ¬p.

**(d) The doubling is itself a certificate generator: the lower
transform.**  Within the cone over the base world, forcing on the two
copies of `emVariant` is computed by syntactic transforms
(`emVariant_force_true/false`, both axiom-free):

    (x, true)  ⊩ M   iff   x ⊩ M[p:=⊤]
    (x, false) ⊩ M   iff   x ⊩ lowT p M

    lowT p p       = ⊥            lowT p (A ⊃ B) = (lowT A ⊃ lowT B)
    lowT p (◯A)    = ◯(A[p:=⊤])                    ∧ (A[p:=⊤] ⊃ B[p:=⊤])

(pointwise on ∧, ∨, atoms ≠ p, ⊥).  So `lowT p M` joins the
substitution instances as one more premise available to the criteria
(`isSemAll_of_certificates_low`, `isSemEx_of_certificates_low`), and
the values beyond substitution fall mechanically:

    ∀p.(p ∨ ¬p) = ⊥      ∀p.(◯p ⊃ p) = ⊥      ∀p.(¬¬p ⊃ p) = ⊥
    (semAll_em_p)         (semAll_boxp_imp_p)   (semAll_nnp_imp_p)

**(d′) The third generator: the sideways-witness construction and
`sideT`.**  The Löb-shaped `◯(◯p ⊃ p)` defeats both substitution and
the doubling.  Its value falls to `lobModel`/`lobVariant`: ℕ-levelled
copies with `Rᵢ` level-monotone but `Rₘ` level-rigid **except the
single step 1 → 2**, `p` decorated on levels ≥ 2.  Level 1 forces ◯p
but not p, so `◯p ⊃ p` fails at level 0 over every non-fallible base
world; level-0 constraint witnesses stay at level 0, so a level-0 world
satisfies `◯(◯p ⊃ p)` only through fallible witnesses:

    ∀p.◯(◯p ⊃ p) = ◯⊥        (semAll_box_lob)

The p-worlds are Rₘ-reachable *sideways* (as constraint witnesses) but
never lie on the Rₘ-cone of level 0 — precisely the promise/Θ mechanism
of the canonical model, surfacing as a variant construction.  The
levels of `lobVariant` again evaluate by syntactic transforms
(`lobVariant_force_high/one/zero`): levels ≥ 2 are the `p:=⊤`
substitution, level 1 is `lowT` again, and level 0 is the new

    sideT p p       = ⊥        sideT p (A ⊃ B) = (sideT A ⊃ sideT B)
    sideT p (◯A)    = ◯(sideT A) ∧ ◯(A[p:=⊤])       ∧ lowT p (A ⊃ B)

with `sideT p (◯(◯p⊃p)) ≡ ◯⊥` exactly.  The criteria now carry the
full generator basis {substitution instances, lowT, sideT}
(`isSemAll_of_certificates_side`, `isSemEx_of_certificates_side`).

**Roadmap observation (no Lean anchor).**  The three generators are the
level-0 transforms of a tower of levelled models (2-chain, 3-level
sideways, …); the ◯/⊃-alternation depth of M bounds the tower depth it
can see, and the finite canonical model over cl(M) bounds it
per-instance.  A uniform definability proof at one variable now has a
concrete shape: show that for every 1-variable M the candidate value
(the maximum closed ξ ⊢ M) is derivable from finitely many generator
instances — the generator set standing in for the promise-aware world
descriptions.  Rows of the value table that resist the current basis
name the next construction.

**(e) Uniqueness** (`semEx_unique`, `semAll_unique`): any two
spec-satisfiers are interderivable, so "the value of ∀p.M" is
well-defined up to ≡ — the probe's candidates, once certified, ARE the
quantifiers.

**(f) The value-table probe** (`wip/semui_probe.lean`): for every
one-variable M up to weight 5 (plus named extras), compute the
candidate ∀p-value (maximum of the closed ξ ⊢ M, over the RN(◯,{})
ladder truncation — 7 classes at weight ≤ 8) and candidate ∃p-value
(minimum of the closed ξ with M ⊢ ξ), then search certificates over
the generator basis.

**(g) Probe results (run completed 2026-07-19; full table + analysis
in `docs/semantic-ui-1pv-table.md`): ALL 25 one-variable classes are
certified on BOTH sides** — the basis {substitution instances, lowT,
sideT} suffices for the whole table; every candidate is a unique
maximum/minimum over the 7-class ladder; the values attained are
{⊥, ◯⊥, ⊤, ¬◯⊥, ◯¬◯⊥}; the probe's values agree with every Lean
theorem where they overlap.  The doubling is needed exactly at
`◯p ⊃ p` and `p ∨ ¬p` (∀-side); the sideways construction exactly at
the ◯-guarded schemata `◯(◯p⊃p)`, `◯(p∨¬p)`, `¬◯p∨◯p` — all on the
∀-side.  (CORRECTION 2026-07-19: the probe's CERT-LOW on the ∃-row of
`¬◯p ∨ ◯p` was a weight-cap artifact; `p := ⊤` also certifies it.  No
∃-side value is known to require a frame-changing generator — that
necessity is machine-checked only on the ∀-side,
`em_p_no_certificate`.)  Definability at one
variable is therefore an empirically complete conjecture with a
uniform proof target: for every one-variable M, the generator
instances {M[p:=⊥], M[p:=⊤], lowT p M, sideT p M} derive the maximum
closed ξ ⊢ M (dually for ∃) — a purely syntactic statement over the
RN lattice.  Oracle pathology recorded in the table doc: failing
`search` cost is chaotic (non-monotone in fuel); successes instant.

**(h) The reconstruction reduction (2026-07-19, overnight session;
PROVED in `LaxLogic/PLLSemUI.lean`).**  Writing `M[χ]` for the
substitution `substP p χ M`, define the p-free candidates

    allCand p M  :=  M[⊥] ∧ M[⊤] ∧ lowT p M ∧ sideT p M
    exCand  p M  :=  M[⊥] ∨ M[⊤] ∨ M[◯⊥] ∨ lowT p M ∨ sideT p M

Because each conjunct/disjunct is a generator instance, one direction
of each spec holds by construction, and (`isSemAll_of_reconstruction`,
`isSemEx_of_reconstruction`, `semAll/semEx_definable_of_reconstruction`)
**definability reduces to two sequent families**, the *reconstruction
sequents*:

    (∀-rec)   M[⊥], M[⊤], lowT p M, sideT p M  ⊢  M
    (∃-rec)   M  ⊢  M[⊥] ∨ M[⊤] ∨ M[◯⊥] ∨ lowT p M ∨ sideT p M

If (∀-rec) holds for M then `allCand p M` IS the ∀p-value of M; dually
for (∃-rec).  Both families are single derivability statements per
instance — decidable, and oracle-testable.

Status of the families, settled the same night, both ways:

**(i) The FIXED bases are REFUTED — machine-checked — and the repairs
identify the per-instance law.**

*∃-side* (`exRec_fails`, `exCand_not_value`): for the biconditional

    bicond p := (¬◯⊥ ⊃ p) ∧ (p ⊃ ¬◯⊥)          (weight 14)

decorating p by the ¬◯⊥-truth set forces `bicond p` everywhere, so
`∃p.(bicond p) = ⊤` (`semEx_bicond_top`, certified by the substitution
`p := ¬◯⊥`) — but on the four-world model w₀ < v₁, w₀ < v₂ < f
(Rₘ = id ∪ {v₂→f}, F = {f}, V(p) = {v₁,f}) all five `exCand` disjuncts
fail at the root while `bicond p` holds.  The oracle independently
confirms this failure and finds the next at `bicond` over ◯¬◯⊥
(weight 16); adding the corresponding ladder substitutions repairs
both.

*∀-side* (`allRec_fails`, `allCand_not_value`): the exhaustive sweep
(`wip/semui_sweep.lean`, ALL 2758 raw one-variable formulas of weight
≤ 7) found exactly 8 failures — all of the **Peirce/stability family**

    (X ⊃ p) ⊃ Y      with  X ∈ {◯⊥, ◯p, ◯◯⊥, ◯◯p},  Y ∈ {p, ◯p}

(plus ◯-prefixed variants).  Machine-checked witness:
`peirce p := (◯⊥ ⊃ p) ⊃ p` on the three-world chain a < b < f with
p decorated by the ◯⊥-truth set: the root forces all four `allCand`
generators but not `peirce p`.  The value exists:
`∀p.((◯⊥⊃p)⊃p) = ◯⊥` (`semAll_peirce`), certified by `p := ◯⊥` —
absent from the four-generator basis.  Adding `M[◯⊥]` to the ∀-pool
repairs ALL EIGHT sweep failures (oracle, instant).

*Deep alternation does NOT grow the frame-changing basis*: iterated
Löb formulas to depth 4, the gap shape `◯(¬◯p ⊃ ◯p)`, and `◯(¬p ∨ ◯p)`
all reconstruct from the existing generators — the escapes are always
ladder-rung SUBSTITUTIONS, never new levelled models (up to the depths
probed).

**The per-instance support law (the corrected conjecture).**  For every
one-variable M, the generator pool

    { M[χ] : χ a closed-fragment rung occurring (as a class) in M }
      ∪ { lowT p M, sideT p M }

reconstructs M on both sides — verified on: the full weight-≤5 value
table, all 2758 weight-≤7 formulas (∀-side with the ◯⊥-rung; ∃-side
as is), the Peirce-8, the bicond family through weight 16, and the
depth-3/4 battery.  Definability at one variable thus reduces (by the
PROVED reduction) to this per-instance reconstruction — a finite-
support statement of exactly the shape of route (c)'s corrected
Corollary-10 analysis: the two routes have converged on the same
per-instance finite object.

A *naive* structural induction on M does not prove the reconstruction:
in the ⊃-case, splitting a hypothesis `A` by (∃-rec for A) yields,
say, `A[⊥]` at the world, and the transform conjunct `A[⊥] ⊃ B[⊥]`
then gives only `B[⊥]` — reassembling `B` needs all of B's
generators, to which the case gives no access.  The missing
ingredient is a JOINT statement tracking which canonical decoration
the world inhabits across all subformulas simultaneously — precisely
what canonical-model descriptions provide.  So the intended uniform
proof is the de Jongh-style induction over the finite canonical model
of cl(M), with the generator family as its computational shadow — and
the refutations above say the descriptions must record exactly the
ladder rungs of cl(M), i.e. the promise/Θ data.

## 1. What was proved today, and what it compresses the problem to

Ghilardi's semantic method characterises the Pitts quantifiers by
*bisimulation*: ∃p.φ holds where some p-variant world forces φ; ∀p.φ
holds where every p-variant of every future forces φ. Today's file sets
this up for constraint models and proves the whole *universal-property*
layer:

* **A-bisimulation** (`ABisim`): zigzag for BOTH relations Rᵢ and Rₘ,
  matching fallibility, matching atoms in a protected alphabet A. The
  p-variant relation is `PBisim p` = protect everything except p.
* **Invariance** (`force_iff_of_bisim`, PROVED): forcing is invariant
  under A-bisimulation for formulas over A. The ⊃-case consumes
  i-zigzag; the ◯-case consumes i-zigzag for the future and m-zigzag
  for the constraint witness; the ⊥-case is why fallibility must match.
* **The universal properties** (PROVED, via the library's `soundness` +
  choice-free `completeness`): any p-free ψ satisfying the semantic
  spec `IsSemEx p φ ψ` satisfies

      φ ⊢ ψ        and        (φ ⊢ χ  ⟺  ψ ⊢ χ)   for every p-free χ

  (`semEx_upper`, `semEx_adjunction`), and dually `IsSemAll` gives
  `ψ ⊢ φ` and `(χ ⊢ φ ⟺ χ ⊢ ψ)` (`semAll_lower`,
  `semAll_adjunction`). These are exactly Pitts' defining properties of
  the uniform interpolants.

**Consequently uniform interpolation for PLL is now equivalent to ONE
open statement per quantifier** — definability:

    semEx_definable :  ∀ p φ, ∃ ψ, IsSemEx p φ ψ        (OPEN)
    semAll_definable : ∀ p φ, ∃ ψ, IsSemAll p φ ψ       (OPEN)

No cascade, no budgets, no threshold arithmetic: the entire task-#9
apparatus is bypassed. If definability is proved, UI follows by the
adjunctions; if it fails, UI fails semantically and the syntactic route
was doomed anyway. This is the value of the route: it terminates either
way, in the same currency as everything else in the repo.

## 2. The battle plan for definability

The intended engine is the constructive finite canonical model
(`PLLFinComp.lean`): worlds are closure-total triples (Γ, Δ, Θ) over a
subformula closure, finitely many per closure, enumerable, checkable.

**Candidate construction (∃-side).** Fix φ and p; let Σ be the closure
of φ and Σ' its p-free part. For each Σ'-triple T that extends to a
Σ-triple whose validated part contains φ, emit a *description* of T; the
candidate interpolant is the finite disjunction of these descriptions.
The novelty PLL forces: a description must pin the ◯-behaviour, and the
canonical model says how — the promises. A triple's description should
have the shape

    desc(T)  =  ⋀Γ_T  ∧  (⋀-of-refutation-content for Δ_T)  ∧  ¬◯(⋁Θ_T)

with the ◯-guarded promise conjunct carrying exactly the information
that the plain intuitionistic description cannot. Making "refutation
content" precise intuitionistically (no classical negation of Δ) is the
de Jongh-style induction — descriptions of a world in terms of the
descriptions of its proper successors — and the place where real work
lives.

**The two PLL-specific hazards, in expected order of difficulty:**

1. **The ∀∃ ◯-clause under amalgamation.** The ← direction of the spec
   requires: from "w forces desc(T)", BUILD a p-variant model and world
   forcing φ. The construction glues the ambient model to a canonical
   witness; the gluing must supply Rₘ-witnesses for every future of
   every glued world coherently. This is where an S4-style definability
   failure would enter (Ghilardi–Zawadowski: S4 has no uniform
   interpolation, and Rᵢ here is S4-shaped). The counter-pressure is
   full heredity — `force_hered` holds through ◯ — which is exactly
   what rescues IPC despite its preorder. Honest status: genuinely
   open which force wins; nothing in our evidence points to failure.
2. **Fallible worlds.** F-worlds force everything, so they are
   universal amalgamation absorbers — probably a HELP (gluing can dump
   incoherence into a fallible sink), but descriptions must not be
   fooled: matching fallibility is already a bisimulation clause, and
   Θ-promises are what distinguish a world pretending to be fallible
   from one committed against it.

**The induction has been started (PROVED, same file, 2026-07-18 pm):**
the universal p-variant constructor `redecorate` (same frame, atom p
re-decorated by any hereditary F-full set; the identity carrier is a
`PBisim p`), and with it the base and pointwise-compositional cases:

    ∃p.p = ⊤    ∀p.p = ⊥    ∃p.q = q  (q≠p)    ∀p.q = q  (q≠p)
    ∃p.⊥ = ⊥    ∀p.⊥ = ⊥    ∃p distributes over ∨    ∀p over ∧

(`semEx_prop_self`, `semAll_prop_self`, `semEx/semAll_prop_ne`,
`semEx/semAll_false`, `semEx_or`, `semAll_and`). What is deliberately
absent is the quantificational core — ∃ through ∧/⊃/◯ (two p-variants
must be AMALGAMATED into one) and ∀ through ∨ — which is exactly where
the canonical-model descriptions must enter and why the general theorem
is not a structural recursion.

**The amalgamation case at one variable — tried, and settled both ways
(PROVED, same file, 2026-07-18 eve):**

* *The obstruction is real and machine-checked*
  (`semEx_and_pointwise_fails`): ∃p.p = ⊤ and ∃p.¬p = ⊤ — but their
  witnessing decorations are INCOMPATIBLE (p everywhere vs p exactly on
  the fallible set), and ∃p.(p ∧ ¬p) = ⊥ (`semEx_p_and_neg_p`), so the
  pointwise candidate ⊤ ∧ ⊤ fails the spec on a one-world model. ∃p
  provably does not commute with ∧: amalgamation is exactly what a
  definability proof must supply.
* *The first genuinely modal quantifier values*
  (`semEx_neg_p`, `semAll_neg_p`, `semEx_box_p`, `semAll_box_p`):

      ∃p.¬p = ⊤    ∀p.¬p = ⊥    ∃p.◯p = ⊤    **∀p.◯p = ◯⊥**

  The last is the telling one: the strongest legal p-decoration is
  p := F, under which ◯p is literally ◯⊥, and `full_F` pins the value
  against every other variant. ◯⊥ — the free generator of the closed
  fragment — is the ∀p-shadow of the modality itself, and this matches
  the {⊥, ◯⊥, ⊤} landscape the one-variable descent probe observed for
  the syntactic interpolants: the two routes are computing the same
  objects.

**Strategic advice to the fresh session:** attack definability at ONE
propositional variable first, over the canonical models of the 1-pv
closures. Everything we know says this case is tiny: the deep probe
found five-class state spaces, and the RN(◯,{}) fragment machinery
(`lattice_cmp`, the closed-fragment enumeration) can *compute* candidate
descriptions and oracle-test the spec's two directions instance by
instance before any general proof is attempted. The two-sided oracle
(proof terms + certified countermodels) means every failed candidate
yields a three-world picture of *why* — the diagrams will tell us the
right description shape faster than theory will.

## 3. Relations to the ⊩ semantics of the Belief paper

Three connections, one now a theorem-adjacent fact, one a conjecture
shape, one a recorded dead-end.

**(a) Truth is bisimulation-invariant; evidence is not.** Invariance is
now proved for forcing. It FAILS deliberately for the realisability
semantics: a ⊩ˢ/⊩ᵖ-strategy receives κ(v), the *name* of the presented
world, and two bisimilar worlds carry different names. Indeed the
Belief paper's obstruction theorem turns exactly on what strategies can
and cannot see of the world's identity. So the realisability semantics
is a *refinement* of the bisimulation quotient: ⊩ distinguishes worlds
that truth cannot. Slogan (no Lean anchor yet): **the propositional
quantifiers live on the bisimulation quotient; evidence lives under
it.** A mechanisable statement: exhibit a model, a PBisim, related
worlds w Z w', and a formula ⊩ᵖ-realised at w but not at w' —
plausibly extractable from the obstruction model.

**(b) The uniform/reactive dichotomy transposes from futures to
atoms.** The Belief paper's central axis is how much evidence is told
about the FUTURE (⊩ᵘ nothing / ⊩ˢ the ◯-future / ⊩ᵖ every future). The
∀p-quantifier introduces the same axis for ATOMS: a realiser of ∀p.φ
should be *one element serving every p-decoration* of the model — a
p-uniform realiser, PLLᵘ's rigidity reappearing one level up. The
paper's lesson "uniformity validates strictly more" then predicts:
evidence for ∀p.φ is strictly stronger than a family of per-decoration
evidences, and the gap should again be exhibited by a disjunction
(◯(A ∨ B)-style) — now with the disjuncts separated by p-decorations
rather than by futures. Conjecture-shaped; a clean small target for
whoever works this seam: formulate `⊩ᵖ`-realisability of ∃p/∀p via
quantification over `Evidence`-decorations of the SAME frame, and test
the analogue of the bite on the split model. If it behaves, the Belief
paper gains a section: *propositional quantifiers as evidence
uniformity* — and UI becomes a statement about evidence, not just truth.

**(c) The constraint-translation route — CORRECTED (Matthew,
2026-07-18): not dead, but requires per-instance finite support.** One
might hope to DERIVE PLL-UI from the mechanised IPC-UI (the box-free
crown) through context completeness (Thm 6: PLL ⊢ φ iff ∀C, IPL ⊢ φ^C).
The naive form does fail — the constraints mention p, and commuting a
p-quantifier past the unrestricted ∀C would need a single finite
constraint set complete for the whole logic, which Corollary 10 refutes.
But — Matthew's point — Corollary 10 is a statement about ALL of PLL,
not about any one interpolation instance: for a SPECIFIC φ the
derivability facts the interpolant must govern may be controlled by a
FINITE set S_φ of constraints, and then a candidate interpolant is
constructible from { IPC-∃p.(φ^C) : C ∈ S_φ }. There is a natural
candidate for S_φ: Lemma 7 manufactures ONE standard constraint per
finite constraint model (the semantic completion), so S_φ = the
constraints of the canonical models over φ's subformula closure — a
finite set, by the finite canonical construction. OPEN: whether the
adjunction properties survive the assembly (the ∀χ over p-free χ ranges
over formulas outside φ's closure; the finite-support claim must be
proved against that quantifier, plausibly via the FMP bound). Status:
a live THIRD route (syntactic cascade / semantic definability /
finite-support constraint transfer), currently unexplored.

**(d) Shared infrastructure.** The finite canonical model is now
carrying three loads: the choice-free completeness (Belief §6.2), the
countermodel emitter, and — if this route lands — UI definability. One
construction, three dividends. The promise components Θ, introduced in
1997 to record ◯-refutations, would become precisely the ◯-part of the
world descriptions: the 30-year-old bookkeeping is the right amount of
information for the quantifiers. That would be a satisfying thing to
be able to say in print.

## 4. Relation to the syntactic route (task #9)

Independent. If definability lands, UI holds and the syntactic
`itpA`/`itpE` become one *candidate presentation* of the quantifiers
(their adequacy then provable by uniqueness-up-to-interderivability
against the semantic ones — a cleaner path than the H1/H2 cascade). If
the syntactic route closes first, its interpolants must satisfy the
semantic spec (by the same uniqueness), and the spec becomes the
crispest statement of what was proved. Either way `IsSemEx`/`IsSemAll`
are now the canonical interface; the two efforts meet there.

each M there is a standard constraint C, built from M à la Lemma 7,
with

    ∀ᴵᴾᶜ p.(M^C) ≡ᴵᴾᶜ (∀p.M)^C          (dually ∃p)

where `M^C = subC C M` (mechanised), the PLL-values are the
spec-verified ones, and ∀ᴵᴾᶜ is computed by the box-free tower
(`itpA`/`itpE`), oracle-compared.  Constraints: Lemma 7's recipe
`(α_u, ⋁ covers)` over Rₘ-stable worlds of concrete finite models.

`∀ᴵᴾᶜp.(p∨¬p) = ⊥` passed): the commutation HOLDS for `◯p`, `¬p`,
`◯⊥ ⊃ p`, `(◯⊥⊃p)⊃p` — and FAILS exactly at `◯p ⊃ p`:
`∀ᴵᴾᶜp.((a1⊃p)⊃p) = a1` (the IPC shadow of the Peirce family — an
independent cross-check of `semAll_peirce_family`) against
`(∀p.(◯p⊃p))^C = ⊥`.  REPAIR VERIFIED (same model): relative to the
frame theory Θ = {α_w ⊃ ⊥ : w fallible}, the failing row commutes —
the tower value is Θ-equivalent to ⊥.

ANALYSIS (recorded as analysis, not machine-checked): a single frozen
C realises exactly the REDECORATION approximation of ∀p — the IPC
quantifier sees decorations of the named frame but not frame-changing
variants.  Every non-fallible Rₘ-stable world contributes an
"α-top residue": at α_u-everywhere IPC-worlds the pair `(α_u, …)`
forces `C[p] ⊢ p`, so `C[p]⊃p`-type translations are forced under
every decoration and the relative value stays ≥ α_u > ⊥; no frame
theory over the same names removes it, and re-generating C from the
doubled model reproduces the residue one level up (the doubling
regress).  PREDICTION (OPEN, runs timeboxed out): frame-relative
commutation for ⊥-valued M holds iff every Rₘ-stable world of the
generating model is fallible; the three-chain and fork models (each
with a non-fallible stable world) fail even frame-relatively.  If
confirmed, the one-constraint form of the conjecture holds exactly up
to the redecoration approximation, and the frame-changing content
demands growing constraint families — reconverging, from the
constraint side, with the per-instance support law of §0(i).

Tooling note: tower cost (raw term construction before nf) is the
binding constraint — chaotic in fuel/budget like the failing-search
cost; rows beyond weight ~7 translations need the fuel/budget caps of
the probe, and some still wedge.  All probe verdicts are sound on
`true`.
