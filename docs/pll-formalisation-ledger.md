# The PLL formalisation in Lean: statement-level ledger

*Generated 2026-07-16, branch `claude/belief-lax-logic-handover-f331bf`,
toolchain Lean v4.31.0 + Mathlib v4.31.0.*

**Paths.** All file references are repository-root-relative (from this `docs/`
directory, prepend `../`). *Promotion note (2026-07-16): under the policy that
nothing in `wip/` is ever claimed as formally proved, the Curry-paper files and
the finished belief modules were moved into the `LaxLogic/` library —
`wip/context_completeness.lean` → [`LaxLogic/PLLCtxCompleteness.lean`](../LaxLogic/PLLCtxCompleteness.lean),
`wip/lax_infinite.lean` → [`LaxLogic/PLLLaxInfinite.lean`](../LaxLogic/PLLLaxInfinite.lean), and the seven
`wip/belief_*.lean` files → `LaxLogic/Belief*.lean` (see
[belief-mechanisation-index.md](belief-mechanisation-index.md)) — all imported
by the library root, so `lake build` checks them. The realisability file
followed on 2026-07-18 — `wip/belief_realisability.lean` →
[`LaxLogic/BeliefRealisability.lean`](../LaxLogic/BeliefRealisability.lean), audits measured and
`#guard_msgs`-pinned on promotion — so only the separate UI-probe files
remain in `wip/`.*

**Purpose.** Lean's kernel checks the *proofs*; what remains for a human is to
check that the *statements* — the definitions and the displayed theorems — say
what they are claimed to say. This ledger is that checklist: each row names a
result, its Lean identifier and location, and its axiom audit, so the human
task reduces to reading the statement at the cited location and agreeing it
formalises the intended claim. Every audit below was **re-run on 2026-07-16**
(not copied from earlier notes) and the affected rows re-measured on
**2026-07-18** after the two `Classical.choice` scrubs — first of the
proof-theory chain, then of the decidability-and-completeness chain
(the choice-free `Finset` toolkit `PLLFinsetKit.lean`, the
height-bounded decider `G4sh.dec`, and the representative-based
world enumeration; see §10's footnote for what remains tainted and
why).  To re-verify any row, run
`lake env lean <file>` for a file containing `#print axioms <name>`.

**Axiom key.**
- **none** — fully constructive: no axioms at all.
- **[p]** = `[propext]`; **[p,Q]** = `[propext, Quot.sound]` — no choice.
- **clean** = `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]` — the ordinary axioms
  of classical Lean.
- No entry uses `sorryAx` (no `sorry` anywhere in `LaxLogic/`) and none uses
  `ofReduceBool`/`native_decide` except where explicitly flagged.

## 7. Decidability of PLL — F&M Theorem 2.8, MECHANISED

*Ledger correction (2026-07-17): an earlier version of §7/§8 wrongly recorded
decidability as "not mechanised". It **is** mechanised — as a full, terminating,
kernel-honest decision procedure — via the **repaired** calculus `G4iLL″`
(`G4h`/`G4c`), not the naive Iemhoff `G4iLL` (`G4`). The naive calculus is
incomplete for PLL (§7.2 below); that incompleteness is exactly what *motivated*
the repair, and the repair carries the decidability.*

### 7.1 The decision procedure (via `G4iLL″` = `G4c`)

| result | Lean name | location | axioms |
|---|---|---|---|
| Repaired calculus proves exactly PLL (proof-theoretic half of Thm 2.8): `G4c Γ φ ↔ Nonempty (Tm Γ φ)` | `G4c.equiv_tm` | [`PLLG4HComp.lean:115`](../LaxLogic/PLLG4HComp.lean) | **[p,Q]** |
| …and `↔ Nonempty (LaxND Γ C)` | `G4c.g4c_iff_nd` (via `equiv_nd`) | [`PLLG4HComp.lean`](../LaxLogic/PLLG4HComp.lean) | **[p,Q]** |
| Cut admissible / completeness of `G4c` | `G4c.cut`, `G4c.completeness` | [`PLLG4HComp.lean`](../LaxLogic/PLLG4HComp.lean) | **[p,Q]** |
| Height-bounded decidability of the cumulative set calculus | `G4sh.dec` (`Decidable (G4sh n Γ C)`) | [`PLLG4Set.lean`](../LaxLogic/PLLG4Set.lean) | **[p,Q]** |
| Set-calculus embedding, choice-free form (`G4c Γ E ↔ G4s (toFin Γ) E`) | `G4c.iff_setFin` | [`PLLG4Set.lean`](../LaxLogic/PLLG4Set.lean) | **[p,Q]** |
| Loop-checked, fuel-bounded backward search decides `G4c` | `G4c_iff_search` | [`PLLG4Dec.lean`](../LaxLogic/PLLG4Dec.lean) | **[p,Q]** — no choice |
| search success ⟹ derivation (choice-free `toFin` form) | `search_sound'` | [`PLLG4Dec.lean`](../LaxLogic/PLLG4Dec.lean) | **[p,Q]** |
| minimal-height derivation ⟹ search success (choice-free; `Nat.find` on `G4sh.dec`) | `search_complete'` | [`PLLG4Dec.lean`](../LaxLogic/PLLG4Dec.lean) | **[p,Q]** |
| **`G4c` is decidable** | `decidableG4c` (`Decidable (G4c Γ C)`) | [`PLLG4Dec.lean`](../LaxLogic/PLLG4Dec.lean) | **[p,Q]** — no choice |
| **PLL provability is decidable** (F&M Thm 2.8): `Decidable (Nonempty (Tm Γ φ))` | `decidablePLL` | [`PLLG4Dec.lean`](../LaxLogic/PLLG4Dec.lean) | **[p,Q]** — no choice |
| legacy `toFinset`-phrased forms | `G4c.iff_set`, `search_sound`, `search_complete`, `height_bound` | [`PLLG4Set.lean`](../LaxLogic/PLLG4Set.lean), [`PLLG4Dec.lean`](../LaxLogic/PLLG4Dec.lean) | clean — statement-tainted‡ |

It is a **full** decision procedure (total `Decidable`, terminates on every
input by the fuel bound + finite gated space + visited-set loop-check), and it is
**kernel-honest**: `#eval decide (Nonempty (Tm [p] p.somehow))` and
`#eval decide (G4c …)` run in `PLLDemos.lean` under `#guard_msgs`, **no
`native_decide`**. `decide`/`#eval` on `decidablePLL` reduce, through
`equiv_tm` and `G4c_iff_search`, to the executable `search`; the loop-check
(visited sequents keyed by the choice-free `toFin`) is the efficiency device
(no re-search), and `decideFuel` is computed arithmetically (the powerset is
never built).

‡ *Statement-tainted* (here and in §7.1a/§10): the statement itself mentions
`List.toFinset` or `Finset.toList`, whose current Mathlib bodies embed
`Classical.choice` (`Multiset.dedup`'s permutation-invariance lemma;
`Multiset.toList` is `Quotient.out`, i.e. choice outright).  `#print axioms`
walks the bodies of statement constants, so these rows cannot audit
choice-free *by any proof*; each has a `[p,Q]` primed form carrying the same
mathematics through the choice-free `toFin`/representative route.

### 7.1a Proof-term emission — fuel-free search (added 2026-07-17)

The verified decider above is a *theorem*, not a practical tool: `decideFuel`
is exponential (it exists only to make the completeness induction go through),
and running `search` to it times out even on the gap sequent.  The practical
searcher lives in [`PLLG4Term.lean`](../LaxLogic/PLLG4Term.lean) and returns
the **derivation itself**:

| result | Lean name | location | axioms |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Type`-valued proof terms for `G4iLL″` (list contexts, membership `Prop`s, `Tm`-style) | `G4cTm` | [`PLLG4Term.lean`](../LaxLogic/PLLG4Term.lean) | — (a datatype) |
| Fuel-free backward searcher emitting terms (untrusted `partial`; loop-checked by canonical list keys — no `decideFuel`, no `enum`) | `prove` / `G4cTm.find` | [`PLLG4Term.lean`](../LaxLogic/PLLG4Term.lean) | — (a program) |
| Every term projects to a `G4s` derivation | `G4cTm.sound'` (choice-free); `G4cTm.sound` (legacy, statement-tainted‡) | [`PLLG4Term.lean`](../LaxLogic/PLLG4Term.lean) | **[p,Q]**; clean |
| A term certifies `G4c`, hence PLL, provability | `G4cTm.toG4c`, `G4cTm.toTm` | [`PLLG4Term.lean`](../LaxLogic/PLLG4Term.lean) | **[p,Q]** |
| Every `G4c`-derivable sequent has a term | `G4cTm.ofG4c` | [`PLLG4Term.lean`](../LaxLogic/PLLG4Term.lean) | **[p,Q]** |
| `Nonempty (G4cTm Γ C) ↔ Nonempty (Tm Γ C)` | `G4cTm.equiv_tm` | [`PLLG4Term.lean`](../LaxLogic/PLLG4Term.lean) | **[p,Q]** |

Trust is factored by the type discipline: the searcher is untrusted code, but
anything it emits inhabits `G4cTm Γ C`, which the kernel checks — *if we can
build a term, Lean can check it*.  The gap sequent
`◯((◯p → r) → ◯p), ◯p → r ⊢ r`, on which running the verified decider timed
out beyond 6.5 minutes, is solved in milliseconds with its derivation tree
emitted (`#eval` smoke tests in the file).

### 7.1b The derivability tactic `pll_g4c` — certificate splicing (added 2026-07-17)

[`PLLRun.lean`](../LaxLogic/PLLRun.lean) packages the searcher as a tactic.
`pll_g4c` runs `G4cTm.find` at *elaboration time* as untrusted code, quotes the
found derivation back into surface syntax (membership side conditions as
explicit `List.Mem` constructor chains — no decision procedure, no axioms), and
the kernel checks the spliced `G4cTm` certificate, transported to the goal by
the §7.1/§7.1a equivalences.  It closes `Nonempty (Tm Γ C)`,
`Nonempty (LaxND Γ C)`, `SC Γ C`, `G4c Γ C`, `G4cTm Γ C` and
`Nonempty (G4cTm Γ C)` for concrete sequents.

- **Complete** (`G4c.equiv_tm`): a search failure *refutes* derivability — an
  underivable specimen (`◯p ⊢ p`) is pinned as an expected error under
  `#guard_msgs`.
- **No `native_decide`**: the trust base of a `pll_g4c` proof is exactly that
  of the transport lemmas — clean-classical for `Tm`/`LaxND`/`SC`/`G4c` goals
  (pinned: `PLLND.unit_nd`), and **no axioms at all** for a bare `G4cTm`
  certificate (pinned: `PLLND.gap_certificate`, the gap-sequent derivation).

This **retires `pll_g4`** (same file, removed 2026-07-17), which ran the
*naive* `G4iLL` (§7.2 — incomplete, so its failures proved nothing) under
`native_decide` (so its successes carried a per-use compiled-evaluator axiom).

### 7.2 The naive Iemhoff `G4iLL` is incomplete (why the repair was needed)

| result | Lean name | location | axioms |
|---|---|---|---|
| The separating sequent is PLL-derivable | `PLLG4Gap.sep_SC` | [`PLLG4Gap.lean:58`](../LaxLogic/PLLG4Gap.lean) | clean |
| …but not naive-`G4iLL`-derivable | `PLLG4Gap.sep_not_G4` | [`PLLG4Gap.lean:340`](../LaxLogic/PLLG4Gap.lean) | **[p]** |
| Contraction not admissible in naive `G4iLL` | `PLLG4Gap.contraction_not_admissible` | [`PLLG4Gap.lean:378`](../LaxLogic/PLLG4Gap.lean) | **[p]** |
| Cut not admissible in naive `G4iLL` | `PLLG4Gap.cut_not_admissible` | [`PLLG4Gap.lean:396`](../LaxLogic/PLLG4Gap.lean) | **[p]** |

(`G4` = naive Iemhoff `G4iLL`, `PLLG4.lean`; `G4h`/`G4c` = repaired `G4iLL″`,
`PLLG4H.lean`. The gap results refute *only* the naive calculus.)

## 8. Open items (stated honestly)

- **Decidability (F&M Thm 2.8): DONE** (§7.1) — this line previously mis-stated it
  as open; corrected 2026-07-17. F&M's own route was via the finite model
  property; the mechanised route is the repaired terminating calculus `G4iLL″`.
  A countermodel **specification** is now proved:
  `not_provable_iff_exists_finite_countermodel` ([`PLLCountermodel.lean`](../LaxLogic/PLLCountermodel.lean),
  clean) — `⊬φ ⟺ ∃ finite constraint model refuting φ` (contrapositive of the
  finite model property). This is the guarantee any extractor must meet and the
  seed for Route B realisability completeness (`route-b-model.md` §6).
  **A computable emitter with a verified checker now exists** (added
  2026-07-17, [`PLLCountermodelEmit.lean`](../LaxLogic/PLLCountermodelEmit.lean)):
  `FinCM` (finite models as data), `forceB` (computable forcing), the
  reflection lemma `force_iff`, and the certificate theorem
  `not_provable_of_check` — **choice-free** `[propext, Quot.sound]`: any
  finite model passing the executable check refutes derivability, by
  soundness.  The emitter `CounterEmit.emit` (untrusted, checker-gated)
  builds worlds as pairs (prime `G4c`-closed theory, coherent refutation
  promises — the syntactic mirror of the filtration's `Fmset`) and emits
  guarded countermodels for `⊬ p`, `◯p ⊬ p`, `⊬ ¬◯⊥` and the
  ∨-distribution `◯(p∨q) ⊬ ◯p∨◯q` (mechanically rediscovering the split
  model), with a pinned kernel-`decide` certificate `somehow_p_not_p` (no
  `native_decide`).  Still open: *completeness of the emitter* (a proof
  that it succeeds on every underivable sequent — the constructive
  upgrade of the Zorn existence inside `completeness`), and the Route B
  step of decorating emitted worlds with evidence (§6 of
  `route-b-model.md`).
- **The uniform-interpolation probe** (`wip/onevar.lean`, `wip/absorb_base.lean`,
  `wip/g4ill_ui.lean`) is a separate research thread and carries the repo's only
  open `sorry`s (5, all listed in those files' headers). No result above depends
  on them. (`height_bound` of §7.1 is the pigeonhole ingredient that route needs.)

## 9. The belief-paper layer (2026-07-14…16)

Statement-level index for the *Belief in Lax Logic* results (Boolean collapse,
`N(B) ≃o B`, normality, introspection/omniscience, open vs closed nuclei, `◯⊥`
facts, small-algebra enumerations): [`belief-mechanisation-index.md`](belief-mechanisation-index.md).
Route B realisability results (the two evidence clauses, heredity, the local
nucleus laws, the separation triptych, the double-negation believer, and
combinatory completeness `Poly.abs_spec` **[p,Q]**): promoted 2026-07-18 to
[`LaxLogic/BeliefRealisability.lean`](../LaxLogic/BeliefRealisability.lean) with all 31 audits
`#guard_msgs`-pinned in-file (headline: `realS_fullness_obstruction` **[p,Q]**
— no choice; `bite_uniform_split`, `extract_sound`, `extractS_sound`,
`force_somehow_iff_notnot` clean); design history in [`route-b-model.md`](route-b-model.md) §8.

## 10. Realisability completeness (promoted 2026-07-17/18)

The `⊩ᵖ` programme, promoted to the library after all proofs closed.  The
narrative: uniformity fails at `∨`-under-`◯` (the bite) and at `⊃` (the
barrier); the barrier provably blocks completeness for `⊩ˢ` (the
obstruction, [`LaxLogic/BeliefRealisability.lean`](../LaxLogic/BeliefRealisability.lean)); presenting the future to the `⊃`-clause
(`⊩ᵖ`) restores it, and the countermodels are supplied Zorn-free by the
finitised canonical model with the mechanised decision procedure making
every Lindenbaum decision.

| **Adequacy + fullness** over token-decorated checked frames | `realP_adequate_and_full` | [`PLLEvidence.lean`](../LaxLogic/PLLEvidence.lean) | **[p,Q]** — no choice |
| **The squeeze**: checked countermodels are `⊩ᵖ`-refutations | `realP_refutes_sequent` | [`PLLEvidence.lean`](../LaxLogic/PLLEvidence.lean) | **[p,Q]** |
| Explicit table algebra; both table hypotheses by construction | `Tbl`, `tblPca`, `tbl_htab`, `tbl_htabP` | [`PLLEvidence.lean`](../LaxLogic/PLLEvidence.lean) | **[p]** |
| Closed capstones (nothing assumed) | `realP_refutes_sequent_tbl`, `somehow_p_not_p_realP_tbl` | [`PLLEvidence.lean`](../LaxLogic/PLLEvidence.lean) | **[p,Q]** |

| **Completeness of PLL for `⊩ᵖ`** (biconditional) | `derivable_iff_no_realP_refutation` | [`PLLRealCompleteness.lean`](../LaxLogic/PLLRealCompleteness.lean) | **[p,Q]** |

The mathematics is finitary (no Zorn; the only case decisions are by
`decidablePLL`, and the crown avoids excluded middle deliberately), and
after the **2026-07-18 scrub the audits above are measured, not
conjectured**: the three former `Classical.choice` sources were drilled
exactly as the 2026-07-17 footnote predicted.  (i) The `decidablePLL`
floor fell to the height-bounded decider `G4sh.dec` (`PLLG4Set.lean`) —
`search_complete'`'s minimal-height `Nat.find` now runs on a real
decision procedure, not `Classical.propDecidable` — together with the
choice-free `Finset` toolkit `PLLFinsetKit.lean` (`toFin`, `finUnion`,
`finImage`, `finPairMap`, `finPow`, `finSdiff`, `finDecEq`: the set
algebra lifted from list operations with *extensionality* as the
permutation-invariance proof, where Mathlib's own operations lean on the
choice-tainted `Perm.dedup`), on which `atoms`, `enum`, `subF`, `clOf`
and `search` are now built.  (ii) The `Finset.toList` uses fell to
`Prop`-level representatives (`exists_rep`: every finset *has* an
enumerating list, by `Quot.ind` — only a canonical choice of one would
need choice): consistency is decided by the Boolean `consB` lifted over
representatives, and the emitter's world list is built inside the proof
(`canonCMof` + sublists of a closure representative).  (iii)
`not_consistent_iff`'s `push_neg` fell to decidable case analysis on the
representative check (`cons_iff_rep`) in `cons_insVal_or_insFal`.  What
*cannot* fall: rows marked ‡ have statements mentioning
`List.toFinset`/`Finset.toList`, choice-tainted inside Mathlib at
definition level, so they stay at `clean` however proved — their
mathematical content is carried choice-free by the primed forms
(`G4c.iff_setFin`, `G4cTm.sound'`, `cons_iff_rep`).

# Part II — the formal definitions and theorem statements

*What follows is the trusted content, verbatim from the sources (proof bodies
stripped): the definitions a reader must accept as formalising the intended
notions, interleaved with the exact statements of the audited theorems. Large
auxiliary machinery (the proof-term calculus, the G4 calculus, the constraint
lattice operations) is pointed to rather than reproduced, and said so. Read
this Part against Part I's audit column.*

## II.1 The language

```lean
inductive PLLFormula where
  | prop (constantName : String)
  | falsePLL
  | and (a b : PLLFormula)
  | or (a b : PLLFormula)
  | ifThen (antecedant consequent : PLLFormula)
  | somehow (a : PLLFormula)          -- the lax modality ◯

abbrev notPLL (F : PLLFormula) : PLLFormula := ifThen F falsePLL
abbrev truePLL := ifThen falsePLL falsePLL
```

`somehow` is `◯`; `notPLL`/`truePLL` are the defined `¬`/`⊤`.

## II.2 Natural deduction ([`PLLNDCore.lean`](../LaxLogic/PLLNDCore.lean))

Contexts are lists; the identity rule is membership-based, so weakening,
exchange and contraction are admissible (`LaxND.rename`), not structural:

```lean
inductive LaxND : List PLLFormula → PLLFormula → Type
  | iden      {Γ φ}   (h : φ ∈ Γ) : LaxND Γ φ
  | falsoElim {Γ} (φ) (p : LaxND Γ .falsePLL) : LaxND Γ φ
  | impIntro  {Γ φ ψ} (p : LaxND (φ :: Γ) ψ) : LaxND Γ (.ifThen φ ψ)
  | impElim   {Γ φ ψ} (p₁ : LaxND Γ (.ifThen φ ψ)) (p₂ : LaxND Γ φ) : LaxND Γ ψ
  | andIntro  {Γ φ ψ} (p₁ : LaxND Γ φ) (p₂ : LaxND Γ ψ) : LaxND Γ (.and φ ψ)
  | andElim1  {Γ φ ψ} (p : LaxND Γ (.and φ ψ)) : LaxND Γ φ
  | andElim2  {Γ φ ψ} (p : LaxND Γ (.and φ ψ)) : LaxND Γ ψ
  | orIntro1  {Γ φ ψ} (p : LaxND Γ φ) : LaxND Γ (.or φ ψ)
  | orIntro2  {Γ φ ψ} (p : LaxND Γ ψ) : LaxND Γ (.or φ ψ)
  | orElim    {Γ φ ψ χ} (p₀ : LaxND Γ (.or φ ψ))
      (p₁ : LaxND (φ :: Γ) χ) (p₂ : LaxND (ψ :: Γ) χ) : LaxND Γ χ
  | laxIntro  {Γ φ}   (p : LaxND Γ φ) : LaxND Γ (.somehow φ)
  | laxElim   {Γ φ ψ} (p₁ : LaxND Γ (.somehow φ))
      (p₂ : LaxND (φ :: Γ) (.somehow ψ)) : LaxND Γ (.somehow ψ)
```

The two lax rules are F&M's `◯I`/`◯E`. Provability of `φ` is
`Nonempty (LaxND [] φ)`.

For conservativity, the IPL fragment is its own judgment (same rules minus the
two lax ones — `IPLND`, [`PLLNDCore.lean:167`](../LaxLogic/PLLNDCore.lean)), and erasure removes `◯`:

```lean
def erase : PLLFormula → PLLFormula     -- ◯φ ↦ erase φ, else homomorphic
def isIPL : PLLFormula → Prop            -- no ◯ anywhere

theorem conservativity_prop {Γ φ} (p : LaxND Γ φ) :
    IPLND (Γ.map erase) (erase φ)

theorem conservativity_IPL {Γ φ} (hφ : isIPL φ) (hΓ : ∀ ψ ∈ Γ, isIPL ψ)
    (p : LaxND Γ φ) : IPLND Γ φ
```

## II.3 Sequent calculus and cut elimination ([`PLLSequent.lean`](../LaxLogic/PLLSequent.lean))

```lean
inductive SCh : Nat → List PLLFormula → PLLFormula → Prop
  | init  {n Γ a}     (h : PLLFormula.prop a ∈ Γ) : SCh n Γ (.prop a)
  | botL  {n Γ C}     (h : PLLFormula.falsePLL ∈ Γ) : SCh n Γ C
  | andR  {n Γ A B}   : SCh n Γ A → SCh n Γ B → SCh (n+1) Γ (A.and B)
  | andL  {n Γ A B C} (h : A.and B ∈ Γ) : SCh n (A :: B :: Γ) C → SCh (n+1) Γ C
  | orR1  {n Γ A B}   : SCh n Γ A → SCh (n+1) Γ (A.or B)
  | orR2  {n Γ A B}   : SCh n Γ B → SCh (n+1) Γ (A.or B)
  | orL   {n Γ A B C} (h : A.or B ∈ Γ) :
      SCh n (A :: Γ) C → SCh n (B :: Γ) C → SCh (n+1) Γ C
  | impR  {n Γ A B}   : SCh n (A :: Γ) B → SCh (n+1) Γ (A.ifThen B)
  | impL  {n Γ A B C} (h : A.ifThen B ∈ Γ) :
      SCh n Γ A → SCh n (B :: Γ) C → SCh (n+1) Γ C
  | laxR  {n Γ A}     : SCh n Γ A → SCh (n+1) Γ (A.somehow)
  | laxL  {n Γ A B}   (h : A.somehow ∈ Γ) :
      SCh n (A :: Γ) (B.somehow) → SCh (n+1) Γ (B.somehow)

def SC (Γ : List PLLFormula) (C : PLLFormula) : Prop := ∃ n, SCh n Γ C
```

Height-indexed, G3-style (principal formulas kept in the context); **no cut
rule**. The audited theorems:

```lean
theorem SC.cut {Γ A C} (h₁ : SC Γ A) (h₂ : SC (A :: Γ) C) : SC Γ C

theorem SC_to_ND : ∀ {n Γ C}, SCh n Γ C → Nonempty (LaxND Γ C)

```

## II.4 Hilbert system ([`PLLAxiom.lean`](../LaxLogic/PLLAxiom.lean), [`PLLHilbert.lean`](../LaxLogic/PLLHilbert.lean))

The axiom schemes (the three `◯`-schemes displayed; the remainder are the
standard IPC schemes `K`, `S`, the `∧`/`∨` rules and ex falso —
[`PLLAxiom.lean:36–60`](../LaxLogic/PLLAxiom.lean)):

```lean
inductive PLLAxiom where
  | somehowR (M) | somehowM (M) | somehowS (M N) | somehowBind (M N)
  | impK (A B) | impS (A B C)
  | andElim1 (A B) | andElim2 (A B) | andIntro (A B)
  | orIntro1 (A B) | orIntro2 (A B) | orElim (A B C)
  | explosion (A)

def PLLAxiom.get : PLLAxiom → PLLFormula
  | somehowR M    => M ⊃ ◯M                    -- ifThen M (somehow M)
  | somehowM M    => ◯◯M ⊃ ◯M
  | somehowS M N  => (◯M ∧ ◯N) ⊃ ◯(M ∧ N)
  | ...                                        -- standard IPC schemes

inductive HdOn (Ax : PLLFormula → Prop) (Γ : List PLLFormula) : PLLFormula → Prop
  | ax  {φ} (h : Ax φ)  : HdOn Ax Γ φ
  | hyp {φ} (h : φ ∈ Γ) : HdOn Ax Γ φ
  | mp  {φ ψ} : HdOn Ax Γ (φ.ifThen ψ) → HdOn Ax Γ φ → HdOn Ax Γ ψ

def PLLAx (φ : PLLFormula) : Prop := ∃ a : PLLAxiom, φ = a.get
abbrev Hd (Γ : List PLLFormula) (φ : PLLFormula) : Prop := HdOn PLLAx Γ φ

/-- F&M Theorem 2.3: Hilbert and natural-deduction consequence coincide. -/
theorem hd_iff_ND {Γ φ} : Hd Γ φ ↔ Nonempty (LaxND Γ φ)
```

Strong extensionality (F&M Theorem 2.5; `iffPLL M N` is `(M⊃N) ∧ (N⊃M)`,
`substProp a M C` is `C[M/a]`):

```lean
theorem strong_extensionality (a : String) (M N C : PLLFormula) :
    Nonempty (LaxND [] ((iffPLL M N).ifThen
      (iffPLL (substProp a M C) (substProp a N C))))
```

## II.5 Kripke constraint semantics ([`PLLKripke.lean`](../LaxLogic/PLLKripke.lean))

```lean
structure ConstraintModel where
  W : Type
  Ri : W → W → Prop        -- intuitionistic accessibility
  Rm : W → W → Prop        -- modal (constraint) accessibility
  F : Set W                -- fallible worlds
  V : String → Set W

  trans_m : ∀ {w v u}, Rm w v → Rm v u → Rm w u
  sub_mi : ∀ {w v}, Rm w v → Ri w v
  hered_F : ∀ {w v}, Ri w v → w ∈ F → v ∈ F
  hered_V : ∀ {a w v}, Ri w v → w ∈ V a → v ∈ V a
  full_F : ∀ {a w}, w ∈ F → w ∈ V a

def force (C : ConstraintModel) : C.W → PLLFormula → Prop

def Consequence (Γ : List PLLFormula) (φ : PLLFormula) : Prop :=
  ∀ (C : ConstraintModel) (w : C.W), (∀ ψ ∈ Γ, C.force w ψ) → C.force w φ

theorem soundness    {Γ φ} (p : LaxND Γ φ) : Γ ⊨- φ            -- F&M Thm 3.3
theorem completeness {Γ φ} (h : Γ ⊨- φ) : Nonempty (LaxND Γ φ)  -- F&M Thm 4.4
```

## II.6 Countermodels (F&M Fig. 3; [`PLLFrames.lean`](../LaxLogic/PLLFrames.lean))

Each is soundness against a small explicit `ConstraintModel` (the models
`modelFallible`, `modelOrSplit`, `modelNoImpDist` are defined at
[`PLLFrames.lean:60–201`](../LaxLogic/PLLFrames.lean) and are `decide`-checkable):

```lean
theorem not_provable_not_somehow_false :
    ¬ Nonempty (LaxND [] (notPLL (somehow falsePLL)))

theorem not_provable_somehow_or_dist :
    ¬ Nonempty (LaxND [] ((somehow ((prop "A").or (prop "B"))).ifThen
        ((somehow (prop "A")).or (somehow (prop "B")))))

theorem not_provable_imp_somehow_dist :
    ¬ Nonempty (LaxND [] (((somehow (prop "A")).ifThen (somehow (prop "B"))).ifThen
        (somehow ((prop "A").ifThen (prop "B")))))
```

## II.7 Strong normalisation ([`PLLTopTop.lean`](../LaxLogic/PLLTopTop.lean))

The proof-term calculus `Tm`, the full one-step reduction `Step` (β for every
connective + `let`-assoc), strong normalisation `SNt`, and normal forms `Nf`
are defined in [`PLLTerms.lean`](../LaxLogic/PLLTerms.lean) / [`PLLProof.lean`](../LaxLogic/PLLProof.lean) / [`PLLNormal.lean`](../LaxLogic/PLLNormal.lean) (not
reproduced — a full calculus). The audited statements:

```lean
theorem strong_normalisation {Γ φ} (t : Tm Γ φ) : SNt t

def Tm.normalize {Γ φ} (t : Tm Γ φ) : Tm Γ φ          -- total normaliser
theorem Tm.normalize_spec {Γ φ} (t : Tm Γ φ) :
    Steps t t.normalize ∧ Nf t.normalize
```

## II.8 Craig interpolation ([`PLLCraig.lean`](../LaxLogic/PLLCraig.lean))

Choice-free primary forms (`atomsList` is built on the kit's `finUnion`):

```lean
theorem craig_interpolation' {Γ₁ Γ₂ C} (h : SC (Γ₁ ++ Γ₂) C) :
    ∃ I : PLLFormula,
      SC Γ₁ I ∧ SC (I :: Γ₂) C ∧
      I.atoms ⊆ atomsList Γ₁ ∧ I.atoms ⊆ finUnion (atomsList Γ₂) C.atoms

theorem craig_implication' {A B} (h : SC [] (A.ifThen B)) :
    ∃ I : PLLFormula,
      SC [] (A.ifThen I) ∧ SC [] (I.ifThen B) ∧
      I.atoms ⊆ A.atoms ∧ I.atoms ⊆ B.atoms
```

Mathlib-phrased wrappers (statement-tainted‡, two lines from the primed):

```lean
theorem craig_interpolation {Γ₁ Γ₂ C} (h : SC (Γ₁ ++ Γ₂) C) :
    ∃ I : PLLFormula,
      SC Γ₁ I ∧ SC (I :: Γ₂) C ∧
      I.atoms ⊆ atomsList Γ₁ ∩ (atomsList Γ₂ ∪ C.atoms)

theorem craig_implication {A B} (h : SC [] (A.ifThen B)) :
    ∃ I : PLLFormula,
      SC [] (A.ifThen I) ∧ SC [] (I.ifThen B) ∧ I.atoms ⊆ A.atoms ∩ B.atoms
```

## II.9 Kleene–Brouwer well-foundedness ([`KleeneBrouwer.lean`](../LaxLogic/KleeneBrouwer.lean))

```lean
def DevLeft (v u : List α) : Prop :=      -- v branches lt-left of u
  ∃ (w : List α) (a b : α) (v' u' : List α),
    v = w ++ a :: v' ∧ u = w ++ b :: u' ∧ lt a b

    WellFounded (KB lt T)

theorem wellFounded_kb'
    (hlt : WellFounded lt) (hpc : …) (hacc : WellFounded (Child T)) :

```

Audit: **no axioms at all** (in-file guard).

## II.10 The Curry-paper results ([`LaxLogic/PLLCtxCompleteness.lean`](../LaxLogic/PLLCtxCompleteness.lean), [`LaxLogic/PLLLaxInfinite.lean`](../LaxLogic/PLLLaxInfinite.lean))

Standard constraints and the expansion `φ^C`:

```lean
def basic (K L x : PLLFormula) : PLLFormula := K.ifThen (x.or L)  -- [K,L]x = K ⊃ (x ∨ L)

abbrev StdCtx := List (PLLFormula × PLLFormula)   -- acts as ⋀ᵢ (Kᵢ ⊃ (x ∨ Lᵢ))
def applyC : StdCtx → PLLFormula → PLLFormula      -- C[x], truePLL for []

def subC (C : StdCtx) : PLLFormula → PLLFormula    -- φ^C: homomorphic, and
  | .somehow φ => applyC C (subC C φ)              --   (◯φ)^C = C[φ^C]
```

```lean
/-- Theorem 6 (context completeness): PLL ⊢ φ  iff  IPL ⊢ φ^C for every C. -/
theorem thm6 {φ} :
    Nonempty (LaxND [] φ) ↔ ∀ C : StdCtx, Nonempty (LaxND [] (subC C φ))

/-- Corollary 10: no finite set of standard constraints is complete. -/
theorem corollary10 (𝔻 : Finset StdCtx) :
    ∃ φ, (∀ C ∈ 𝔻, Nonempty (LaxND [] (subC C φ))) ∧ ¬ Nonempty (LaxND [] φ)

    (∀ C, Cequiv (Cjoin C (Cbar C)) Ctop)
-- bundled as a Mathlib instance:  BooleanAlgebra CQuot   (CQuot = StdCtx/≈)
```

The infinite closed fragment:

```lean
def Le (a b : PLLFormula) : Prop :=       -- Lindenbaum preorder, semantically
  ∀ (M : ConstraintModel) (w : M.W), M.force w a → M.force w b
  -- (coincides with derivability: le_iff_nonempty)

def LaxEquiv (a b : PLLFormula) : Prop := Le a b ∧ Le b a
def Closed := {φ : PLLFormula // atomFree φ = true}
instance closedSetoid : Setoid Closed where r x y := LaxEquiv x.1 y.1 …

/-- The closed lax fragment RN(◯,{}) is infinite. -/
theorem closed_lax_infinite : Infinite (Quotient closedSetoid)
```

## II.11 Decidability — F&M Theorem 2.8 ([`PLLG4H.lean`](../LaxLogic/PLLG4H.lean), [`PLLG4Dec.lean`](../LaxLogic/PLLG4Dec.lean))

The repaired calculus `G4iLL″` is `G4h` (height-indexed) / `G4c`; the decider is
the loop-checked backward `search` over the set calculus (both large, not
reproduced — see `PLLG4H.lean`, `PLLG4Dec.lean`). The bridge and the two
`Decidable` instances:

```lean
def G4c (Γ : List PLLFormula) (C : PLLFormula) : Prop := ∃ n, G4h n Γ C

/-- G4iLL″ proves exactly the PLL sequents (proof-theoretic half of Thm 2.8). -/
theorem G4c.equiv_tm {Γ φ} : G4c Γ φ ↔ Nonempty (Tm Γ φ)

/-- The loop-checked, fuel-bounded search decides G4c. -/
theorem G4c_iff_search {Γ C} :
    G4c Γ C ↔
    search (listWeight (C :: Γ)) (listAtoms (C :: Γ)) (decideFuel Γ C) ∅ Γ C = true

instance decidableG4c (Γ C) : Decidable (G4c Γ C) :=
  decidable_of_iff _ G4c_iff_search.symm

/-- F&M Theorem 2.8: PLL provability (term-calculus inhabitation) is decidable. -/
instance decidablePLL (Γ φ) : Decidable (Nonempty (Tm Γ φ)) :=
  decidable_of_iff _ G4c.equiv_tm
```

A full, terminating, kernel-honest decider (`#eval decide (Nonempty (Tm [p] p.somehow))`
runs under `#guard_msgs` in `PLLDemos.lean`; no `native_decide`).

## II.12 The naive-G4iLL incompleteness gap ([`PLLG4Gap.lean`](../LaxLogic/PLLG4Gap.lean))

The *naive* Iemhoff calculus (`G4`, contraction-free) is defined in
[`PLLG4.lean`](../LaxLogic/PLLG4.lean) (not reproduced); these results show it is
incomplete for PLL — the motivation for the `G4iLL″` repair above:

```lean
def Fa : PLLFormula := ((prop "p").somehow).ifThen (prop "r")   -- F' = ◯p ⊃ r
def Ga : PLLFormula := Fa.ifThen (prop "p").somehow             -- G' = F' ⊃ ◯p

theorem sep_SC     : SC [Ga.somehow, Fa] (prop "r")             -- PLL derives it
theorem sep_not_G4 : ¬ G4 [Ga.somehow, Fa] (prop "r")           -- G4iLL cannot

theorem contraction_not_admissible :
    G4 [Ga.somehow, Fa, Fa] (prop "r") ∧ ¬ G4 [Ga.somehow, Fa] (prop "r")

theorem cut_not_admissible :
    G4 [Ga.somehow, Fa] ((prop "p").somehow) ∧
    G4 [(prop "p").somehow, Ga.somehow, Fa] (prop "r") ∧
    ¬ G4 [Ga.somehow, Fa] (prop "r")
```
