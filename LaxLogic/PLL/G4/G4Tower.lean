# Multiplicity experiments: Howe's original sequent, and the tower question

Two machine-checked data points about *how much* contraction the
consuming calculus `G4` (Iemhoff's G4iLL) is missing, run through the
verified decider of `PLLDecide.lean`.

1. **Howe's original sequent** (MSCS 2001, §5)
   `B⊃((◯A⊃C)⊃◯A), ◯B, ◯A⊃C ⇒ C` is `G4`-underivable, and derivable
   once the implication `◯A⊃C` is doubled — the same contraction
   failure as the packaged gap sequent of `PLLG4Gap.lean`, on Howe's
   own instance.

2. **The naive tower does not climb.**  Stacking another antecedent —
   `T₂ := ◯(F→(F→◯p))` with `F := ◯p→r` — still needs only *two*
   copies of `F`, not three: `G4`'s additive branching hands each
   premise its own copy of the context, so only `F`-firings nested
   along a *single branch* compound; antecedent-stacking spreads the
   uses across sibling branches.  Whether some sequent needs
   multiplicity 3 (equivalently: whether `G4` with a single built-in
   duplication is still incomplete) is open — and mechanically
   searchable with this decider.
