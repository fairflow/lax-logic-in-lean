# The `◯`-free base of G4iLL is Dyckhoff's G4ip, and it *is* complete

`PLLG4Gap.lean` shows that Iemhoff's calculus **G4iLL** (our `G4`,
arXiv:2209.08976 Fig. 2.3) is incomplete for PLL: `SC [◯G', F'] r` holds
while `¬ G4 [◯G', F'] r` (both kernel-checked, `sc_but_not_G4`).  This
file locates the defect exactly.  On sequents containing no `◯` — where
`G4` is literally Dyckhoff's G4ip (JSL 57(3), 1992) and `SC` is G3ip —
the equivalence Iemhoff claims **does** hold:

    (∀ ψ ∈ Γ, isIPL ψ) → isIPL C → SC Γ C → G4 Γ C

(`G4.completeness_isIPL`), and hence `G4 Γ C ↔ SC Γ C ↔ IPLND Γ C` on
the fragment (`G4.iff_SC_isIPL`, `G4.iff_IPLND`).  So the incompleteness
of G4iLL is created **exactly** by its two `◯`-antecedent implication
rules `R◯→`/`L◯→` (`impLLax`, `impLLaxLax`) together with `L◯`
(`laxL`) — not by the propositional base it inherits from Dyckhoff.
`G4.base_complete_gap_modal` packages the two halves as one statement.

## Route

The proof does **not** re-run Dyckhoff–Negri's contraction-admissibility
induction for G4ip.  It goes through the repaired calculus `G4c`
(**G4iLL″**, `PLLG4H.lean`), whose completeness `SC Γ C → G4c Γ C` is
already unconditional (`G4c.completeness`, `PLLG4HComp.lean`, resting on
the contraction lemma of `PLLG4HCtr.lean` and `selfAbsorb` of
`PLLG4HCut.lean`).  What makes this legitimate here — and is the one
observation the file contributes — is that

* `G4h`'s **propositional** rules (`init`, `botL`, `andR`, `orR1`,
  `orR2`, `impR`, `andL`, `orL`, `impLProp`, `impLBot`, `impLAnd`,
  `impLOr`, `impLImp`) are *verbatim* `G4`'s, modulo the height index:
  the repair of `PLLG4H.lean` touches only the three modal rules
  (`laxL`, `impLLax`, `impLLaxLax`), where `G4c` keeps material that
  `G4` consumes;
* those three modal rules cannot fire on a `◯`-free sequent, since each
  needs a principal formula containing `◯` (`◯A` in the context for
  `laxL`, `◯A ⊃ B` in the context for the other two), and `laxR` cannot
  fire because its conclusion is `◯A`;
* `◯`-freeness is inherited by the premises of every propositional
  rule — each premise formula is built from subformulas of the
  conclusion (`A ⊃ (B ⊃ D)` from `(A ∧ B) ⊃ D`, and so on).

So a `G4h` derivation of a `◯`-free sequent is, rule for rule, a `G4`
derivation: `G4h.toG4_isIPL` is a plain structural induction in which
the four modal cases are discharged by contradiction.  Had `G4c` been
cumulative where Dyckhoff consumes *in the propositional rules*, this
route would have needed contraction for `G4` after all; it is not, and
it does not.

`isIPL` is the repository's `◯`-freeness predicate (`PLLNDCore.lean`),
the same one `conservativity_IPL` is stated with.

## Provenance (`docs/calculus-map.md`)

`G4` = Iemhoff's G4iLL; `SC`/`SCh` = G3iLL; `G4h`/`G4c` = this
repository's repair G4iLL″; `LaxND` = the natural-deduction system
`Deriv` of the map; `IPLND` = intuitionistic natural deduction
(`PLLNDCore.lean`).  On `◯`-free sequents `G4` is Dyckhoff's G4ip and
`SC` is G3ip, so the results below are statements about **IPC**, proved
inside the PLL formalisation.

/-- **The `◯`-free restriction of G4iLL″ is G4iLL.**  A `G4h` derivation
of a `◯`-free sequent uses only the propositional rules, which `G4` has
verbatim; the four modal cases are impossible.

This is the step that lets the already-proved completeness of `G4c`
(`G4c.completeness`) be transported to the incomplete `G4`, without
re-proving contraction admissibility for Dyckhoff's calculus. -/

/-- **The incompleteness of G4iLL is created by its `◯` rules.**  Both
halves in one statement:

* on `◯`-free sequents the calculus is complete for the cut-free G3
  calculus — every propositional rule of Iemhoff's calculus is
  Dyckhoff's, and the argument never leaves the fragment;
* with `◯` present it is not: `◯G', F' ⇒ r` is `SC`-derivable and
  `G4`-underivable (`PLLG4Gap.sc_but_not_G4`), and the sequent's
  underivability turns precisely on `L◯→` consuming its implication.

So no repair of the propositional base can close the gap, and none is
needed: the repair `G4c` of `PLLG4H.lean` changes only the modal
rules. -/

Peirce's law is `◯`-free and G4-underivable, so `completeness_isIPL`
