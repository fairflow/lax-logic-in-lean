# Uniform interpolation, phase 4: the truncated quantifiers (v3)

The v2 quantifiers (`PLLG4UI.lean`) are adequate at every fuel above
the consumer's height (`PLLG4UIAdq.lean`), but the fuel cannot be
eliminated by a stabilization argument: the A-side hits an off-by-one
cascade at same-set positions (`docs/ui-endgame.md`).  This file
rebuilds the definition so that no fuel is needed — uniformity holds
*by construction*:

* **omission** — context clauses whose mirrored premise is the
  conclusion's own sequent (all inserted pieces already present, same
  goal) are dropped; the adequacy proof already skips those steps
  (retention absorbs them), and the dropped clause is provably
  redundant *as a formula* (it is set-congruent to the whole);
* **jump budget** — v2's clause shapes are kept verbatim, including
  every `◯(E ⇢ A)`-guard, but each *same-context* recursive
  reference (the `impLLax` head/γ clauses, the `impLImp` side premise
  at a present piece, the `A13` guard at a present antecedent, and
  the `E`-components of the ◯-goal disjuncts) recurses at budget
  `b − 1`; context growth pays into the space defect instead.
  Premise-1 chains keep the context identical, so minimal consumers
  never need more budget than the space's jump-goal count; the
  absorption lemma makes budgets above that threshold provably
  interchangeable — a congruence, usable in any position;
* **N-truncation** — the self-referential ◯-goal disjunct is replaced
  by `◯(E ⇢ ⋁ other disjuncts)`; its consumption opens with `laxL`
  and modus ponens, its landing closes by identity after cutting in
  the induction hypothesis (the monad-multiplication move of
  `lax_fixpoint`).

Design lesson recorded from the first attempt (2026-07-11): an
*ambient-relative* equivalence such as the bare law
`◯(E ⇢ Z) ⊣⊢ ◯Z given E` (proved below as `box_guard_collapse` /
`box_guard_intro`, still useful at consumption sites) is NOT a
congruence, so it may not be folded into negatively-occurring
subterms of the definition — the γ-clause antecedents have no
ambient `E` to redeem them.  (The probe divergence that prompted
this repair later resolved as a comparison artifact — v2 had not
converged at low fuel on the gap-theorem context, while v3 was
already budget-stable at the limit — but the guarded shapes are
kept: they are what the adequacy case-map's induction hypotheses
deliver, and budget-annotation is the congruence-grade device.)

This file: the G4c-level proof engines, the measure layer, and the
definition.  The re-proved tower follows.

/-! ### Guard absorption (the bare law)

`◯(E ⇢ Z)` and `◯Z` are interchangeable in any context that holds
`E`: collapse is retained modus ponens under the box, introduction is
monotonicity.  This is what lets the same-context clauses of the
truncated quantifiers drop the self-referential `E`-guards that v2
carried (and that made its recursion non-well-founded). -/

/-! ### The truncated quantifiers

`itpE p S fuel b Γ` / `itpA p S fuel b Γ C`.  Recursion structure:

* **space guards** — context-growing clauses driven by a `Γ`-formula
  fire only when their new pieces lie in the space `S` (a
  piece-closed finset fixed at instantiation); real runs always
  satisfy this, and it makes the growth pay strictly into
  `defect := (S \ Γ.toFinset).card`.  Goal-driven growth (`A13` at a
  fresh antecedent) needs no space guard: the goal-weight slot pays.
* **budget `b`** — every same-context recursive reference (`impLLax`
  head/γ, `impLImp` side premise at a present piece, `A13` at a
  present antecedent, the `E`-components of the ◯-goal disjuncts)
  recurses at `b − 1`; at `b = 0` those clauses are dropped (values
  below the jump-goal threshold are never consumed).
* **fuel** — a shadow parameter: every recursive call strictly
  decreases `mu := (defect + b)·(W₀+1) + goalweight` (`W₀` bounds the
  space's weights and the initial goal's), so above `mu` the fuel is
  syntactically irrelevant; the indifference lemma turns this into
  unfold equations for the packaged, fuel-free quantifiers.

/-! ### Fuel monotonicity

More fuel means a *stronger* ∃-quantifier and a *weaker* ∀-quantifier,
exactly as for the v2 quantifiers (`inter_fuel_mono`): the two halves
are proved simultaneously because the `(E ⇢ A)`-guards flip variance.
The space guards and omission guards mention neither fuel nor budget,
so the two sides always take the same branch; the budget-gated clauses
pair up at the same budget. -/

/-! ### Budget monotonicity

A larger jump budget means a *stronger* ∃-quantifier and a *weaker*
∀-quantifier, at every fixed fuel: the budget-gated clauses vanish at
`b = 0` (a subset of the conjunct/disjunct table, so nothing to prove
resp. nothing to map), and at successor budgets the components pair up
with budgets `(b', b)` against `(b, b+1)` — the ∀-quantified induction
hypotheses cover every pairing.  The induction is on fuel; the budget
is handled by the same local splits as in `itp_fuel_mono`. -/

Composing the single steps with cut closes any budget gap, at every
fixed fuel — the absorption device that will make budgets above the
jump-goal threshold interchangeable. -/

/-! ### Soundness (Pitts E1/A1)

`itpE p S fuel b Γ` is a consequence of `Γ`, and `itpA p S fuel b Γ C`
suffices for `C` alongside `Γ` — at every fuel *and every budget*.
One mutual fuel induction at the `G4s` level, exactly as for the v2
quantifiers: omission and space guards only remove obligations, the
budget-gated clauses are instances of the ∀-budget induction
hypotheses, and the one new case — the truncation disjunct — opens
with `laxL`, fires its guard by modus ponens against E1 at the inner
fuel, and lands on the same per-disjunct obligations as the main
proof (the `hOTH` bundle below serves both consumers). -/
