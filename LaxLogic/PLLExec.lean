# The compiled driver: canonical helpers, named instances, IO drivers

This file is the single home for the mechanisation's *computational* (as
opposed to *proof-theoretic*) functions — the ones previously exercised only
via ad-hoc `#eval` inside probe/theory files (`wip/*probe*.lean`,
`PLLRun.lean`-style demos).  It contains **no `#eval` and no `theorem`**: it
is a program file, run through the `laxrun` CLI (`Main.lean` at the repo
root), not exercised at elaboration time.  Native compilation is the point —
an `itpE`/`itpA` differencing run over million-node interpolants takes ~55 s
interpreted and would be ~1 s compiled.  **Known toolchain issue**: on the
current pin (v4.22.0-rc3 + Mathlib cache) the native `lake exe laxrun`
binary is miscompiled by the code generator and crashes at startup, so the
CLI currently runs through the interpreter: `scripts/laxrun.sh <args>`
(= `lake env lean --run Main.lean <args>`).  Full analysis and the repro
are in `Main.lean`'s header; retest after any toolchain bump.

## Contract: how to add a named instance

Each subcommand reads a `List Xxxlnstance` table below and looks an entry up
by `name : String`.  To add one:

1. Build whatever `PLLFormula`/`List PLLFormula`/`Finset PLLFormula` values
   you need (private `def`s just above the table are the house style — see
   `G0`/`S0`, `G2`/`S2`, `G3`/`S3` for the pattern).
2. Append a record literal to the relevant table (`searchInstances`,
   `quantInstances`, `zooInstances`) with a fresh `name` and a one-line
   `note` explaining what it demonstrates or what verdict to expect.
3. That's it — the driver (`runSearch`/`runQuant`/`runZoo`) and `Main.lean`'s
   dispatch need no changes; they already iterate the table generically.

No formula-parser is provided or needed: instances are named Lean values,
not user-typed syntax.

## Contract: how to add a subcommand

1. Write a pure driver `runFoo : List String → IO Unit` (or `IO Unit` if it
   takes no arguments) in the "Drivers" section below, following the
   existing ones: parse `args`, look up any named instance(s), compute with
   the *existing* library functions (never redefine them here — this file
   re-exports the canonical copies, it does not fork new ones), print with
   `IO.println`/`IO.eprintln`.
2. Add one dispatch arm to `Main.lean`'s `match` on the first CLI argument.
3. Mention it in `runHelp`'s usage text.

## What is deliberately not here

`wip/packaging.lean`'s `pieceClosure`/`mu`/`defect` are not re-exported:
`wip/` is not a library module (it is not built by `lake build`, and its
files `import` each other by bare name, not `LaxLogic.*`), so nothing there
can be imported here without either promoting it to a library module first
(out of scope for this pass) or duplicating its ~250-line closure
computation. No subcommand in the deliverable list needs it, so it is
skipped outright rather than half-ported.

/-! ## Part 1 — the algebra zoo (canonical copy)

Finite Heyting algebras with a nucleus are sound for PLL, so a pointwise
disagreement between two formulas under some valuation refutes their
interderivability — in time linear in formula size.  This was duplicated
verbatim across `wip/fragprobe1.lean`, `wip/stabprobe1.lean`,
`wip/v3probe2.lean`, `wip/v3probe4.lean`; this is now the one copy.

Models: 3-chain `0 < 1 < 2` with nuclei `id`, `max · 1`, `0↦0 else 2`,
`const 2`; and the Boolean diamond `2×2` on bits `{0,1,2,3}` with nuclei
`id`, `||| 1`, `||| 2`. -/

`box`, carried on an explicit list of elements (so valuations can be

/-! ## Part 4 — drivers

Every driver is pure `IO`: no `#eval`, no elaboration-time computation. -/

/-- `laxrun timing` — the standalone delay calculator: the `Tm.eval`
extractions on the `CIRC` (`PLLTiming.lean`) and carry-skip-adder
(`PLLTimingAdder.lean`) proof terms, at the nominal sky130 operating point.

Each printed value is the closed form that the library *proves* equal to
the `Tm.eval` extraction of the corresponding proof term — `circUp_rising`,
`circUp_a1_bound`, `coutSkip_bound`, `ripple_bound` (all `rfl`/`omega`,
kernel-checked at build time) — so these numbers are certified extraction
results.  We evaluate the closed forms rather than calling `Tm.eval` at
runtime because the dependently-typed evaluator (its result type is the
type family `sem`) crashes the v4.22.0-rc3 interpreter with SIGBUS
(erased-type arity confusion; minimal repro: `#eval (circUp.eval (· + ·) 0 B
(envCIRC 120 40 90) (0, ()) (0, ())).1`).  The theory files never hit this
because they pin these numbers by `rfl`/`decide` — kernel reduction, not
the interpreter.  Once a toolchain bump fixes the exe/codegen path, the
`Tm.eval` calls can be restored verbatim here. -/
