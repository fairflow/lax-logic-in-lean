# The per-instance reconstruction law, made exact

The semantic mainline (route doc §0(i)): definability of the
bisimulation quantifiers at one variable reduces to RECONSTRUCTION
SEQUENTS over a per-instance generator pool — substitution instances
of `M` at the closed-fragment rungs OCCURRING IN `M` (plus ⊥, ⊤, and
on the ∃-side ◯⊥), together with the two frame transforms `lowT`,
`sideT`.  Until now the law lived as prose plus per-instance oracle
certificates; this file makes it exact:

* `rungsIn M` — the closed (atom-free) subformulas of `M`;
* `poolAll p M` / `poolEx p M` — the per-instance generator pools;
* `allCandP p M = ⋀ poolAll` / `exCandP p M = ⋁ poolEx` — the
  candidate values;
* `isSemAll_of_poolRec` / `isSemEx_of_poolRec` — the REDUCTIONS,
  PROVED: if the pool reconstructs `M` (`⋀pool ⊢ M`, resp.
  `M ⊢ ⋁pool`), the candidate satisfies the quantifier spec — for
  EVERY `M`, not just one-variable;
* `ReconLawAll` / `ReconLawEx` — the LAW itself as sorry-free `Prop`
  conjectures, stated at one variable (where the evidence lives);
* `onevar_definable_of_laws` — the law implies one-variable
  definability, both quantifiers;
* `pool_reconstructs_peirce` — the machine-checked pin: the
  per-instance pool reconstructs the Peirce witness `(◯⊥⊃p)⊃p` that
  REFUTED the fixed four-generator basis (`allRec_fails`), because
  the occurring rung ◯⊥ contributes the decisive instance.

Status words: the reductions and the pin are PROVED; the law is OPEN
(machine evidence: every formula of weight ≤ 7, the depth-3/4
battery, and every named witness; no counterexample known).

CORRECTION (2026-07-19, certified by the law sweep): the
occurring-rungs-only pool is REFUTED — witness `((◯p)⊃p)⊃p`, whose
Peirce pivot ◯p contains p, so it has NO atom-free subformulas and
the occurring-only pool degenerates to the fixed basis, which
provably fails there (`occurring_only_insufficient` below, a
`decide`-checked countermodel).  The base instance ◯⊥ is needed

/-! ## The pin: the pool reconstructs the Peirce witness

The fixed four-generator basis provably fails on `(◯⊥⊃p)⊃p`
(`allRec_fails`); the per-instance pool contains the instance at the
OCCURRING rung ◯⊥, namely `(◯⊥⊃◯⊥)⊃◯⊥ ≡ ◯⊥ = ∀p.((◯⊥⊃p)⊃p)`, and
reconstruction goes through.  Machine-checked, so the law's
characteristic mechanism — the pool grows with the rungs of `M` — is
witnessed in Lean, not only by the oracle. -/

/-! ## The correction pins: why the base rung ◯⊥ is unconditional

The ◯p-pivoted Peirce formula `((◯p)⊃p)⊃p` has NO atom-free
subformulas — its pivot contains p — so an occurring-rungs-only pool
degenerates to the fixed four-generator basis there, and that basis
provably fails: the three-world countermodel found (and
checkB-verified) by the law sweep discharges by `decide`. -/
