# The chain criteria: refutation instruments for the two quantifiers

`PROGRESS-POLAR.md` §5: `∃p φ` is the least element of the filter of `p`-free
consequences of `φ`; `∀p φ` the greatest element of the ideal of `p`-free
formulas entailing `φ`.  Each fails exactly when a strictly monotone chain of
`p`-free formulas escapes — descending and coinitial for `∃p`, ascending and
cofinal for `∀p`.

(In fact monotonicity of the chain is NOT needed — the proofs consume only the
per-step strictness and the trapping, so the hypotheses ask for less than the
prose above.  Found by the unused-variable linter.)

This file proves the two criteria, **generic in the chain and in the class of
"`p`-free" formulas** (any predicate `P`), so that a future witness `φ` plus a
chain instantly refutes the corresponding quantifier.  Both are five-line
lattice arguments; their value is that they turn each hunt into exactly two
checkable obligations.

**Scope, stated plainly (Matthew's point, 2026-08-08 evening).**  These
criteria are REFUTATION-ONLY.  For the positive direction they are useless:
proving that *no* chain escapes, for *every* `φ`, is not a route.  The
positive route is the second-order candidate method — see
`LaxLogic/PLLCandLeast.lean`, built alongside this file.

/-- **The `∃p` refutation criterion.**  If a strictly descending chain `D` of
`P`-formulas lies above `φ` and is coinitial among `φ`'s `P`-consequences,
then `φ` has no least `P`-consequence — no post-interpolant. -/

`φ`, then `φ` has no greatest `P`-antecedent — no pre-interpolant. -/
