# Tactics distilled from the PLL normalisation development

Three patterns recurred across `PLLSubst`, `PLLNormal`, `PLLStrongNorm` and
`PLLReducibility` often enough — and cost enough iteration when written by
hand — to be worth packaging before the ⊤⊤-lifting session consumes them at
scale:

* `mirror` — the *congruence-mirror* step: a goal `R (c t₁ … tₙ) (c t₁' … tₙ')`
  closed by the matching constructor of `R`, premises discharged from
  hypotheses (induction hypotheses included, instantiating their
  quantifiers).  Collapses the 17–22-case inductions that translate one
  step relation into another (`toStep`, preservation under
  renaming/substitution, `step_split`).

* `lift_cases` — the pointwise σ-algebra step: a goal
  `∀ ψ (v : Var (χ :: Γ) ψ), lhs v = rhs v` where both the `here` and
  `there` cases hold by `rfl`.  This is the binder case of every
  composition law.

* `Acc.pairInduction` / `Acc.tripleInduction` — simultaneous accessibility
  induction on two or three terms, packaged as eliminators.  The hand-rolled
  version (revert invariants / nest `induction … with | intro` / re-intro /
  rebuild `Acc` witnesses with `.intro`) was the single most error-prone
  move in the reducibility file; these eliminators do the bookkeeping once,
  in term mode, so the motive is explicit and nothing is silently
  generalized.  Stated for arbitrary relations so they serve `RStep` today
  and full `Step` in the ⊤⊤ file.

/-! ### Congruence mirroring -/

/-- Close a goal headed by an inductive relation by applying its (first
unifying) constructor, then discharging the premises with `solve_by_elim`
over the local context.  Intended for congruence cases of step-relation
inductions, where the matching constructor is shape-determined and its
premise is the induction hypothesis (possibly at an instantiated
renaming/substitution). -/
macro "mirror" : tactic => `(tactic| (constructor <;> solve_by_elim))

/-! ### Pointwise lifted-variable analysis -/

/-- Discharge a pointwise goal `∀ ψ (v : Var _ ψ), lhs v = rhs v` (the
binder case of a σ-algebra law) when both the `here` and `there` cases are
definitional. -/
macro "lift_cases" : tactic =>
  `(tactic| (intro _ v; cases v with
      | here => rfl
      | there _ => rfl))

/-! ### Simultaneous accessibility induction -/

universe u v w

/-- Accessibility induction with the accessibility witness re-supplied to
the step case (the raw recursor drops it, forcing manual `.intro`
reconstruction at every use). -/

/-- Simultaneous accessibility induction on a pair: prove `P a b` given
that `P` may assume itself at any `r`-predecessor of `a` (same `b`) and at
any `q`-predecessor of `b` (same `a`).  The step hypothesis also receives
both accessibility witnesses. -/
