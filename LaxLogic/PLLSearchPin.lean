# Pinning a found proof: from *evidence* to *theorem*

The two-sided oracle already returns a **typed** proof term: `Verdict.proved`
carries `t : G4cTm Γ C`, and `G4cTm.toG4c` turns it into `G4c Γ C`.  So when
the searcher says `PROVED`, Lean's typechecker has already checked a
derivation.  What has been missing is a way to get that derivation into a
*source file*, so that the fact survives as a theorem rather than as a line of
probe output.

Running the searcher inside the kernel is not an option — it is deliberately
kernel-opaque, and `decide` on a hundred-thousand-node search is infeasible.
The refutation side has never had this problem: a countermodel is *data*, and
`FinCM.checkB M w Γ C = true` is a cheap kernel computation, which is why every
refutation in this development is pinned as a theorem.  This file gives the
positive side the same standing.

## How

`G4cTm.toLeanSrc` prints a proof term as Lean source.  The trick that makes the
output short is to emit **no formulas at all**.  Every index of every
constructor is recovered by unification:

* the conclusion's `Γ` and `C` come from the expected type;
* each side formula (`A`, `B`, `D`, `X`, `a`) is determined by the *membership
  proof*, which is emitted structurally as a `.tail _ (… (.head _))` chain
  pointing at a position in `Γ`.  Unifying `A.and B` with the formula at that
  position determines `A` and `B`.

The chain is computed from the member's position in `Γ`, not by recursion on
the membership proof — `List.Mem` is `Prop`-valued, so a `String`-valued
function cannot eliminate it.

Because the emitted term mentions no formulas, its size is proportional to the
*derivation*, not to the (very large) tables that occur in the sequents this
development cares about.

## Use

    #pinsrc Γ ⊢ C                    -- default config
    #pinsrc Γ ⊢ C with cfg           -- explicit config

prints either `PROVED — paste this: …` or the reason no certificate was found.
Paste the term into a file as

    theorem my_fact : G4c Γ C := (<pasted term> : G4cTm Γ C).toG4c

and the kernel checks it.  Nothing about the search is trusted: the pasted term
is re-elaborated and re-checked from scratch.
