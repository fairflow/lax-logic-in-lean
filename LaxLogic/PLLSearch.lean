# `PLLND.Search` — a sound-both-ways, incomplete decision aid for PLL sequents

This module packages a single entry point, `PLLND.Search.decide`, that
attempts to settle a propositional lax logic (PLL) sequent `Γ ⊢ C` **either
way**: it looks for a proof and, in parallel, for a finite countermodel.
Every non-`unknown` verdict carries a *kernel-checkable certificate*:

* a `.proved` verdict carries a proof term `G4cTm Γ C` of the terminating,
  contraction-free calculus G4iLL″ — Lean's typechecker validates it, so
  correctness is the type system's job, not the search code's;
* a `.refuted` verdict carries a finite constraint model `M`, a world `w`,
  and a proof `FinCM.checkB M w Γ C = true` produced by the **verified**
  countermodel checker (`PLLCountermodelEmit.lean`).  The certificate
  theorem `FinCM.not_provable_of_check` upgrades it to a machine-checked
  `¬ Nonempty (LaxND Γ C)`;
* `.unknown` is explicit and honest: it means only that the bounded stages
  below found nothing.  It never asserts anything about `Γ ⊢ C`.

The intended use is as a *tool* in the tools-vs-proofs discipline: the
search itself may be fallible, but its accepted outputs are verified, so a
wrong internal guess can only degrade a verdict to `.unknown` — never
produce a false `.proved` or `.refuted`.

## How to use

The configuration is the first argument; pass `{}` for the default search
(you cannot omit it and still give `Γ`, `C` positionally).

```
open PLLND PLLND.Search

-- Decide a sequent (returns an `Answer Γ C`).
#eval (match decide {} [] (((PLLFormula.prop "p").somehow).ifThen (.prop "p")) with
        | .proved _      => "provable"
        | .refuted _ _ _ => "refuted by a finite countermodel"
        | .unknown       => "unknown")

-- Extract the kernel-checked underivability theorem from a refutation:
example : ¬ Nonempty (LaxND [] (((PLLFormula.prop "p").somehow).ifThen (.prop "p"))) :=
  match h : decide {} [] (((PLLFormula.prop "p").somehow).ifThen (.prop "p")) with
  | .refuted _ _ hc => refuted_sound hc
  | _               => by simp_all  -- (does not arise for this sequent)
```

Pass a custom `Config` to widen or narrow the search — most usefully to
supply extra frames for the countermodel battery:

```
-- A five-world chain added to the default battery.
def myCfg : Config :=
  { frames := ⟨5, [(0,1),(1,2),(2,3),(3,4),(0,2),(0,3),(0,4),(1,3),(1,4),(2,4)],
                  [(0,1)], [4]⟩ :: defaultFrames }
#eval (decide myCfg [] someSequent).toDecision
```

Cap the positive stage with a node budget when probing sequents that may
grind (unprovable but missed by the battery):

```
#eval (decide {findBudget := some 200000} Γ C).toDecision  -- fast, honest
#eval prove?Bounded 200000 Γ C                             -- positive engine only
```

## Cost profile (honest)

* **Successes are cheap.**  A true sequent is closed by the fuel-free
  backward searcher `G4cTm.find`, and a false sequent with a small
  countermodel is caught by the frame battery; both are observed to return
  effectively instantly, even at large formula weight.
* **The worst case is exponential.**  `G4cTm.find` is backward proof search
  over a terminating calculus, so it *always* halts, but no polynomial
  bound exists: provability is already PSPACE-hard for the `◯`-free
  intuitionistic fragment.  A false sequent that escapes the battery forces
  `find` to grind through its (finite, exponential) search space before
  failing.
* **The grind is cappable.**  `Config.findBudget := some b` runs the
  positive stage under a global budget of `b` visited sequents
  (`G4cTm.findBounded`); exhaustion degrades the stage to `.unknown`.  The
  budget is shared across the whole search tree — a failed branch hands its
  remainder to the next alternative — so it bounds total work, not just
  depth.  For scale: the gap sequent `◯((◯p→r)→◯p), ◯p→r ⊢ r` visits 825
  nodes; a 3-premise ◯-implication pool against an unreachable goal already
  exhausts its full space at 7,256 nodes, and each further premise
  multiplies that — the multi-minute thrashes observed in probe sessions
  are this growth at ~25 premises.
* **The battery is incomplete by design.**  It enumerates hereditary atom
  decorations of a fixed list of small frames (≤ 4 worlds by default) and
  stops any frame whose decoration count exceeds `comboCap`.  It is a
  cheap first filter, not a complete refuter.
* **`emit` is complete over the subformula closure, but exponential**, so
  it is gated by `emitClosureCap`: it is tried only when the closure is
  small enough to be affordable.

## Trust

Verified (kernel-checked):

* `FinCM.checkB` and the certificate theorem `FinCM.not_provable_of_check`
  — a `.refuted` answer's model genuinely refutes the sequent;
* the proof-term soundness chain `G4cTm.toG4c` ▸ `G4c.equiv_nd` — a
  `.proved` answer's term genuinely witnesses `Nonempty (LaxND Γ C)`.

Untrusted, but harmless:

* the fast vector scan `forceV` and the decoration enumeration.  They only
  ever *propose* candidate countermodels; every candidate must clear the
  verified `FinCM.checkB` before it is returned, so the scan can cause
  **misses**, never a wrong certificate;
* `G4cTm.find` returning `none` proves *nothing* — it is not a completeness
  oracle, only a (fuel-free, loop-checked) searcher.  Likewise
  `G4cTm.findBounded`: a budget cutoff (`(none, 0)`) is a mere truncation,
  and even its search-space-exhausted `none` (budget remaining) proves
  nothing more than `find`'s.

No component uses `native_decide`; the certificates reduce in the kernel.

/-! ## 0. Normalisation (optional PLL-equivalence preprocessing)

The rewrites below are all PLL equivalences — Heyting `⊥`/`⊤` laws together
with `◯⊤ ≡ ⊤` and `◯◯ ≡ ◯` — so they are valid on every constraint model: a
model refutes the normalised form iff it refutes the original, and
provability transfers both ways.  Their *only* role here is to shrink
formulas before the untrusted stages (the vector scan and `emit`).  Every
certificate is re-checked against the **original** `Γ`, `C`, so this
preprocessing can never be load-bearing for soundness. -/

chain with `Rₘ` empty (a *rigid* modal step); (5) the chain with no
fallible top; (6) a three-world chain, rigid except for the middle step;
(7) the full three-world chain; (8) a four-world fork; (9) a three-world

/-! ## 3. Fast untrusted evaluation: bottom-up world vectors

`FinCM.forceB` (the verified checker's forcing function) recomputes each
subformula once per visited world, so its cost is `n^depth` — prohibitive on
heavy formulas.  `forceV` instead evaluates each subformula *once* as a
Boolean vector over all worlds (total cost `weight × n²`).  It is untrusted:
the vectors are only used to *pick candidates*, which are then re-validated
by the verified `FinCM.checkB`. -/

/-! ## 4. Hereditary decorations of a frame

An atom's truth-set must be *hereditary* along `Rᵢ` (upward closed) and must
contain every fallible world.  We enumerate such truth-sets as `n`-bit masks,
then form all assignments of masks to the sequent's atoms. -/

/-- The admissible truth-sets of a frame, as bitmasks: hereditary along `ri`
and containing every fallible world. -/
def admissible (f : Frame) : List Nat :=
  (List.range (2 ^ f.n)).filter fun m =>
    ((List.range f.n).all fun w =>
      !(m.testBit w) ||
        (List.range f.n).all fun v => !(riStep f w v) || m.testBit v) &&
    (f.fall.all fun w => m.testBit w)

def atomsOf (l : List PLLFormula) : List String :=
  (l.flatMap atomList).eraseDups

/-! ## 5. The certified battery sweep

`sweepCert` scans the battery of frames, decorated over the sequent's atoms,
using the fast vector evaluator on the (normalised) formulas `Γ'`, `C'`.
Every scan hit is confirmed through a **dependent** application of the
verified `FinCM.checkB` **on the original** `Γ`, `C`, so the returned witness
carries a genuine proof `FinCM.checkB M w Γ C = true`.  A wrong scan can only
fail the gate and be skipped. -/

/-- A certified countermodel witness: a finite model `M`, a world `w`, and a
proof that the verified checker accepts it for the original sequent. -/
abbrev Witness (Γ : List PLLFormula) (C : PLLFormula) : Type :=
  (M : FinCM) × (w : Nat) ×' (FinCM.checkB M w Γ C = true)

/-- Scan the battery for a certified countermodel.  Candidates are picked by
the fast scan on the normalised forms `Γ'`, `C'`; each candidate is gated by
the verified checker on the **original** `Γ`, `C`. -/
def sweepCert (cfg : Config)
    (Γ' : List PLLFormula) (C' : PLLFormula)
    (Γ : List PLLFormula) (C : PLLFormula) : Option (Witness Γ C) :=
  let ats := atomsOf (C' :: Γ')
  cfg.frames.findSome? fun f =>
    let adm := admissible f
    if adm.length ^ ats.length > cfg.comboCap then none
    else
      (assigns ats adm).findSome? fun asgn =>
        let M := toFinCM f asgn
        let vΓ := Γ'.map (forceV M)
        let vC := forceV M C'
        (List.range f.n).findSome? fun w =>
          if vΓ.all (fun v => v.getD w false) && !(vC.getD w false) then
            if h : FinCM.checkB M w Γ C = true then some ⟨M, w, h⟩ else none
          else none

/-! ## 6. The certified `emit` stage

`CounterEmit.emit` proposes a countermodel from the subformula closure (it is
complete over that closure, but exponential).  Run on the normalised forms
and re-gated on the original sequent. -/

/-- Run the closure-based emitter on `Γ'`, `C'`; gate any proposal through the
verified checker on the original `Γ`, `C`, returning a certified witness. -/
def emitCert (Γ' : List PLLFormula) (C' : PLLFormula)
    (Γ : List PLLFormula) (C : PLLFormula) : Option (Witness Γ C) :=
  match CounterEmit.emit Γ' C' with
  | some (M, w) =>
      if h : FinCM.checkB M w Γ C = true then some ⟨M, w, h⟩ else none
  | none => none

/-! ## 7. The answer type and the decision procedure -/

/-- The result of a search, carrying its certificate.

* `proved t`      — `t : G4cTm Γ C` is a proof term of G4iLL″;
* `refuted M w h`  — `h` proves the verified checker accepts model `M` at
  world `w` as a countermodel to `Γ ⊢ C`;
* `unknown`        — the bounded stages found nothing; asserts nothing. -/
inductive Answer (Γ : List PLLFormula) (C : PLLFormula) where
  | proved  : G4cTm Γ C → Answer Γ C
  | refuted : (M : FinCM) → (w : Nat) → FinCM.checkB M w Γ C = true → Answer Γ C
  | unknown : Answer Γ C

/-- **The staged decision procedure.**  In order:

1. the certified battery sweep (`sweepCert`) — a cheap certified refutation;
2. the fuel-free backward searcher `G4cTm.find` on the **original** sequent —
   the positive engine, returning a kernel-checkable proof term for `Γ ⊢ C`
   (capped at `cfg.findBudget` visited nodes when that is set, via
   `G4cTm.findBounded`; exhaustion degrades this stage to a failed search,
   never to a negative verdict);
3. the closure emitter `emitCert`, gated by `emitClosureCap` — a
   complete-over-the-closure but exponential refuter;
4. `unknown`.

The normaliser feeds only stages 1 and 3 (the untrusted proposers); the
proof term from stage 2 and both refutation certificates are about the
original `Γ`, `C`. -/
def decide (cfg : Config := {}) (Γ : List PLLFormula) (C : PLLFormula) :
    Answer Γ C :=
  let Γ' := Γ.map nf
  let C' := nf C
  match sweepCert cfg Γ' C' Γ C with
  | some ⟨M, w, h⟩ => .refuted M w h
  | none =>
    match (match cfg.findBudget with

/-! ## 8. Soundness — turning certificates into theorems

These are the two lemmas that make the interface trustworthy.  Each consumes
exactly the certificate that the corresponding `Answer` constructor carries,
so a user goes from a verdict to the corresponding (un)derivability theorem in
one application. -/

/-- A `.proved` certificate yields a natural-deduction derivation.  The chain
is `G4cTm.toG4c` (proof term ⇒ G4c derivation) followed by `G4c.equiv_nd`
(G4c = PLL natural deduction). -/
theorem proved_sound {Γ : List PLLFormula} {C : PLLFormula} (t : G4cTm Γ C) :
    Nonempty (LaxND Γ C) :=

/-! ## 9. Convenience wrappers -/

/-- Positive engine only: the fuel-free backward searcher for `Γ ⊢ C`,

def prove? (Γ : List PLLFormula) (C : PLLFormula) : Option (G4cTm Γ C) :=
  G4cTm.find Γ C

/-- Positive engine with a **node budget**: `G4cTm.findBounded` capped at
`budget` visited sequents.  A found term is kernel-checkable exactly as with
`prove?`; `none` means only "not settled within `budget` nodes" — an honest
unknown, never a negative verdict.  To tell a genuine search-space
exhaustion (the same `none` as `prove?`) from a budget cutoff, call
`G4cTm.findBounded` directly and inspect the remaining budget; the
difference `budget - remaining` also serves as a node-count profile for
tuning budgets. -/
def prove?Bounded (budget : Nat) (Γ : List PLLFormula) (C : PLLFormula) :
    Option (G4cTm Γ C) :=
  (G4cTm.findBounded budget Γ C).1

countermodel witness, or `none`. -/

    if (CounterEmit.closureOf Γ' C').length ≤ cfg.emitClosureCap then
      emitCert Γ' C' Γ C
    else none

/-! ## 10. Smoke tests and axiom audit

Both verdicts are exercised on tiny sequents, and the two soundness theorems
are audited: their axiom sets are subsets of
`[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]` — no `sorryAx`, no
`Lean.ofReduceBool` (hence no `native_decide`). -/
