# `PLLND.Search` — a sound-both-ways, incomplete decision aid for PLL sequents

## Reading order

1. **`LaxLogic/PLLSearch.lean`** (this file) — the specification: what the
   staged procedure does, what is verified, what it costs.
2. **`LaxLogic/PLLSearchCmd.lean`** — the `#search` / `#refute` /
   `#refuteConf` commands.  Start here if you only want to *ask* about a
   sequent; they print the verdict, the evidence and a paste-ready theorem.
3. **`LaxLogic/PLLSearchEx.lean`** — worked examples: the thirteen Hilbert
   axioms run through the API, and the extraction lemma.
4. **`LaxLogic/PLLSearchConf.lean`** — the PCLL half (`ConfluentU.DerivU`):
   confluence-filtered refutation and its certificate theorem.
5. **`LaxLogic/PLLG4Term.lean`** — the engine: proof terms for G4iLL″ and the
   fuel-free (optionally budgeted) backward searcher.
6. `docs/search-manual.md` — the same material for a logician who knows PLL
   but not this codebase.

## What this module is

It packages a single entry point, `PLLND.Search.settle` (called `decide`
until the rename; `decide` survives as an alias), that attempts to settle a
propositional lax logic (PLL) sequent `Γ ⊢ C` **either way**: it looks for a
proof and, in parallel, for a finite countermodel.  Every non-`unknown`
verdict carries a *kernel-checkable certificate*:

* a `.proved` verdict carries a proof term `G4cTm Γ C` of the terminating,
  contraction-free calculus G4iLL″ — Lean's typechecker validates it, so
  correctness is the type system's job, not the search code's;
* a `.refuted` verdict carries a finite constraint model `M`, a world `w`,
  and a proof `FinCM.checkB M w Γ C = true` produced by the **verified**
  countermodel checker (`PLLCountermodelEmit.lean`).  The certificate
  theorem `FinCM.not_provable_of_check` upgrades it to a machine-checked
  `¬ Nonempty (LaxND Γ C)`;
* `.unknown` is explicit: it means only that the bounded stages below found
  nothing.  It never asserts anything about `Γ ⊢ C`.  `settleWhy` returns
  the richer `Verdict`, whose `.unknown` carries a `Reason` naming which
  bound bit (budget, closure cap, or "all stages ran and missed").

The intended use is as a *tool* in the tools-vs-proofs discipline: the
search itself may be fallible, but its accepted outputs are verified, so a
wrong internal guess can only degrade a verdict to `.unknown` — never
produce a false `.proved` or `.refuted`.

## How to use

Shortest route: the commands of `PLLSearchCmd.lean`, which print the
verdict, the evidence, and a paste-ready pinned theorem.

```
import LaxLogic.PLLSearchCmd
open PLLFormula PLLND PLLND.Search

#search [] ⊢ (prop "p").ifThen ((prop "p").somehow)
#refute [] ⊢ ((prop "p").somehow).ifThen (prop "p")
```

As functions there are two argument orders.  The *sequent-first* wrappers
(§10) default the configuration, and default it to `budgetedConfig` (node
budget on):

```
#eval (verdict [] someSequent).summary          -- one line
#eval (verdictWhy [] someSequent).summary       -- one line, with the reason
#eval (countermodel [] someSequent).map (·.render)
#eval (proof [] someSequent).map (·.pretty)
#eval (verdict Γ C (cfg := { findBudget := none })).summary   -- budget off
```

The *configuration-first* primitives keep the original signatures, so
`settle {} Γ C` (and its alias `decide {} Γ C`) behave exactly as `decide`
always did — in particular with **no** node budget:

```
open PLLND PLLND.Search

#eval (match settle {} [] (((PLLFormula.prop "p").somehow).ifThen (.prop "p")) with
        | .proved _      => "provable"
        | .refuted _ _ _ => "refuted by a finite countermodel"
        | .unknown       => "unknown")

-- Extract the kernel-checked underivability theorem from a refutation:
example : ¬ Nonempty (LaxND [] (((PLLFormula.prop "p").somehow).ifThen (.prop "p"))) :=
  match h : settle {} [] (((PLLFormula.prop "p").somehow).ifThen (.prop "p")) with
  | .refuted _ _ hc => refuted_sound hc
  | _               => by simp_all  -- (does not arise for this sequent)
```

Pass a custom `Config` to widen or narrow the search — most usefully to
supply extra frames for the countermodel battery:

```
-- A five-world chain added to the default battery.
def myCfg : Config :=
  { frames := ⟨5, [(0,1),(1,2),(2,3),(3,4),(0,2),(0,3),(0,4),(1,3),(1,4),(2,4)],
                  [(0,1)], [4]⟩ :: defaultFrames }
#eval (settle myCfg [] someSequent).toDecision
```

Cap the positive stage with a node budget when probing sequents that may
grind (unprovable but missed by the battery):

```
#eval (settle {findBudget := some 200000} Γ C).toDecision  -- fast, honest
#eval prove?Bounded 200000 Γ C                             -- positive engine only
```

## Cost profile

* **Successes are cheap.**  A true sequent is closed by the fuel-free
  backward searcher `G4cTm.find`, and a false sequent with a small
  countermodel is caught by the frame battery; both are observed to return
  effectively instantly, even at large formula weight.
* **The worst case is exponential.**  `G4cTm.find` is backward proof search
  over a terminating calculus, so it *always* halts, but no polynomial
  bound exists: provability is already PSPACE-hard for the `◯`-free
  intuitionistic fragment.  A false sequent that escapes the battery forces
  `find` to grind through its (finite, exponential) search space before
  failing.
* **Measured node counts** (nodes visited by `find`, i.e.
  `budget - remaining` from `G4cTm.findBounded`; re-measured on this tree,
  2026-07-27):

  | sequent | nodes | outcome |
  |---|---:|---|
  | `⊢ p ⊃ ◯p` | 3 | proved |
  | `⊢ ◯◯p ⊃ ◯p` | 7 | proved |
  | `⊢ (p ⊃ q ⊃ r) ⊃ (p ⊃ q) ⊃ p ⊃ r` | 8 | proved |
  | `⊢ ((p ⊃ q) ⊃ p) ⊃ p` (Peirce) | 8 | exhausted |
  | `⊢ (p ∧ ◯q) ⊃ ◯(p ∧ q)` | 18 | proved |
  | `◯((◯p ⊃ r) ⊃ ◯p), ◯p ⊃ r ⊢ r` (the gap sequent) | 136 | proved |

  The gap sequent used to cost 825 nodes; the order-canonical loop key and
  the failure memo have landed since, and the figure is now **136**.

* **How the grind grows.**  Three families of underivable sequents against
  an unreachable atom `z`, measured the same way (times are elapsed
  interpreter time on this machine, so read the ratios, not the absolutes):

  | family | k=1 | k=2 | k=3 | k=4 | k=5 | k=6 |
  |---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
  | A: `◯aᵢ ⊃ b` (k of them) with `◯cᵢ` (k of them) | 11 | 109 | 637 | 2801 | 10411 | 34693 |
  | B: chained `◯aᵢ ⊃ ◯aᵢ₊₁` with `◯a₀` | 34 | 596 | 7125 | 67608 | 544671 | >3·10⁶ |
  | C: `(pᵢ ⊃ q) ⊃ pᵢ` (Peirce shapes) | 7 | 49 | 277 | 1345 | 5921 | 24409 |

  Family B is the "◯-implication pool" the previous version of this header
  quoted at 7,256 nodes for k=3; the current figure is **7,125**.  Growth is
  about ×9 per premise for B, ×3.3 for A, ×4.2 for C.  Family B takes 26 s
  at k=5 and over three minutes at k=6 — so the multi-minute thrashes start
  at *six* chained premises, not the "~25" the old header claimed.

* **The grind is cappable.**  `Config.findBudget := some b` runs the
  positive stage under a global budget of `b` visited sequents
  (`G4cTm.findBounded`); exhaustion degrades the stage to `.unknown`.  The
  budget is shared across the whole search tree — a failed branch hands its
  remainder to the next alternative — so it bounds total work, not just
  depth.  Node throughput on the families above is 7,000–21,000 nodes per
  second (it falls as contexts grow), so `defaultFindBudget = 200000`, the
  budget the sequent-first wrappers and the commands use, bounds a grinding
  search at roughly 10–30 seconds.  Lower it for sweeps.
* **The battery is incomplete by design.**  It enumerates hereditary atom
  decorations of a fixed list of small frames (≤ 4 worlds by default) and
  stops any frame whose decoration count exceeds `comboCap`.  It is a
  cheap first filter, not a complete refuter.
* **`emit` is complete over the subformula closure, but exponential**, so
  it is gated by `emitClosureCap`: it is tried only when the closure is
  small enough to be affordable.

## Trust

Verified (kernel-checked):

* `FinCM.checkB` and the certificate theorem `FinCM.not_provable_of_check`
  — a `.refuted` answer's model genuinely refutes the sequent;
* the proof-term soundness chain `G4cTm.toG4c` ▸ `G4c.equiv_nd` — a
  `.proved` answer's term genuinely witnesses `Nonempty (LaxND Γ C)`.

Untrusted, but harmless:

* the fast vector scan `forceV` and the decoration enumeration.  They only
  ever *propose* candidate countermodels; every candidate must clear the
  verified `FinCM.checkB` before it is returned, so the scan can cause
  **misses**, never a wrong certificate;
* `G4cTm.find` returning `none` proves *nothing* — it is not a completeness
  oracle, only a (fuel-free, loop-checked) searcher.  Likewise
  `G4cTm.findBounded`: a budget cutoff (`(none, 0)`) is a mere truncation,
  and even its search-space-exhausted `none` (budget remaining) proves
  nothing more than `find`'s.

No component uses `native_decide`; the certificates reduce in the kernel.

/-! ## 0. Normalisation (optional PLL-equivalence preprocessing)

The rewrites below are all PLL equivalences — Heyting `⊥`/`⊤` laws together
with `◯⊤ ≡ ⊤` and `◯◯ ≡ ◯` — so they are valid on every constraint model: a
model refutes the normalised form iff it refutes the original, and
provability transfers both ways.  Their *only* role here is to shrink
formulas before the untrusted stages (the vector scan and `emit`).  Every
certificate is re-checked against the **original** `Γ`, `C`, so this
preprocessing can never be load-bearing for soundness. -/

/-- A finite intuitionistic-with-fallibility frame, as raw data.  Worlds are
`0, …, n-1`; `ri` lists the *strict* intuitionistic order (assumed
transitively closed, reflexivity added on use); `rm ⊆ ri` is the constraint
relation; `fall` lists the fallible worlds (which force everything). -/

fallible top; (6) a three-world chain, rigid except for the middle step;
(7) the full three-world chain; (8) a four-world fork; (9) a three-world

/-- Tuning parameters for `decide`.  All fields default, so `({} : Config)`
gives the standard search. -/
structure Config where
  /-- Frames used by the countermodel battery.  Defaults to `defaultFrames`;
  prepend your own frames (as extra shapes) to search a wider space. -/
  frames : List Frame := defaultFrames
  /-- Skip a battery frame when its number of admissible decorations, raised
  to the number of atoms, exceeds this cap.  Guards the enumeration against
  combinatorial blow-up on atom-rich sequents. -/

  /-- Skip the (complete-over-the-closure but exponential) `emit` stage when
  the subformula closure of the sequent is larger than this. -/
  emitClosureCap : Nat := 12
  /-- Node budget for the positive stage.  `none` (the default) runs the
  fuel-free `G4cTm.find` unchanged; `some b` caps the searcher at `b` visited
  sequents (`G4cTm.findBounded`), so a sequent whose search space is too big
  degrades to `.unknown` instead of grinding.  Budget exhaustion is never
  evidence of underivability.

  Note the deliberate asymmetry with the *sequent-first* wrappers of §11
  (`verdict`, `countermodel`, `proof`) and the `#search`/`#refute` commands:
  those default to `budgetedConfig`, which sets `findBudget := some
  defaultFindBudget`.  This field's own default stays `none` so that every
  existing caller of `decide {} …` / `settle {} …` keeps exactly the
  behaviour it had. -/
  findBudget : Option Nat := none
  /-- Extra acceptance test on a *candidate* countermodel, applied before the
  verified `FinCM.checkB` gate in both refutation stages.  The default accepts
  everything; `PLLSearchConf.lean` sets it to `RNC.confB` to keep only
  mutually confluent models, which is what a PCLL refutation needs.

/-! ## 3. Fast untrusted evaluation: bottom-up world vectors

`FinCM.forceB` (the verified checker's forcing function) recomputes each
subformula once per visited world, so its cost is `n^depth` — prohibitive on
heavy formulas.  `forceV` instead evaluates each subformula *once* as a
Boolean vector over all worlds (total cost `weight × n²`).  It is untrusted:
the vectors are only used to *pick candidates*, which are then re-validated
by the verified `FinCM.checkB`. -/

`FinCM.forceB` but computes each subformula once. -/

/-! ## 4. Hereditary decorations of a frame

An atom's truth-set must be *hereditary* along `Rᵢ` (upward closed) and must
contain every fallible world.  We enumerate such truth-sets as `n`-bit masks,
then form all assignments of masks to the sequent's atoms. -/

    (f.fall.all fun w => m.testBit w)

/-! ## 5. The certified battery sweep

`sweepCert` scans the battery of frames, decorated over the sequent's atoms,
using the fast vector evaluator on the (normalised) formulas `Γ'`, `C'`.
Every scan hit is confirmed through a **dependent** application of the
verified `FinCM.checkB` **on the original** `Γ`, `C`, so the returned witness
carries a genuine proof `FinCM.checkB M w Γ C = true`.  A wrong scan can only
fail the gate and be skipped. -/

/-- A certified countermodel witness: a finite model `M`, a world `w`, and a
proof that the verified checker accepts it for the original sequent. -/
abbrev Witness (Γ : List PLLFormula) (C : PLLFormula) : Type :=
  (M : FinCM) × (w : Nat) ×' (FinCM.checkB M w Γ C = true)

/-- Scan the battery for a certified countermodel.  Candidates are picked by
the fast scan on the normalised forms `Γ'`, `C'`, filtered by `cfg.accept`
(the identity filter by default); each candidate is gated by the verified
checker on the **original** `Γ`, `C`. -/

          else none

/-! ## 6. The certified `emit` stage

`CounterEmit.emit` proposes a countermodel from the subformula closure (it is
complete over that closure, but exponential).  Run on the normalised forms
and re-gated on the original sequent. -/

/-- Run the closure-based emitter on `Γ'`, `C'`; gate any proposal through the
verified checker on the original `Γ`, `C`, returning a certified witness.

The trailing `accept` argument is the same untrusted pre-filter as
`Config.accept`; it defaults to the identity filter, so every existing call
site keeps its behaviour. -/
def emitCert (Γ' : List PLLFormula) (C' : PLLFormula)
    (Γ : List PLLFormula) (C : PLLFormula)
    (accept : FinCM → Bool := fun _ => true) : Option (Witness Γ C) :=

      if !(accept M) then none
      else if h : FinCM.checkB M w Γ C = true then some ⟨M, w, h⟩ else none
  | none => none

/-! ## 7. The answer type and the decision procedure -/

/-- The result of a search, carrying its certificate.

* `proved t`      — `t : G4cTm Γ C` is a proof term of G4iLL″;
* `refuted M w h`  — `h` proves the verified checker accepts model `M` at
  world `w` as a countermodel to `Γ ⊢ C`;
* `unknown`        — the bounded stages found nothing; asserts nothing. -/
inductive Answer (Γ : List PLLFormula) (C : PLLFormula) where
  | proved  : G4cTm Γ C → Answer Γ C
  | refuted : (M : FinCM) → (w : Nat) → FinCM.checkB M w Γ C = true → Answer Γ C
  | unknown : Answer Γ C

/-! ### Why an answer was `unknown`

`Answer.unknown` says nothing about *which* bound bit, which is exactly the
information a user needs in order to know which knob to turn.  Rather than
give `Answer.unknown` an argument — which would break every existing
`match … | .unknown => …` in the probe files — the reason lives on a second,
richer result type, `Verdict`, of which `Answer` is the forgetful view. -/

/-- Why a search returned no verdict.  Each constructor names the knob. -/
inductive Reason where
  /-- The positive stage was truncated by `Config.findBudget` (the recorded
  `Nat` is the budget that ran out).  Raise `findBudget`, or set it to
  `none`; the search space was *not* exhausted, so nothing at all is known. -/
  | budgetExhausted (budget : Nat)

/-- **The staged decision procedure, with reasons.**  In order:

1. the certified battery sweep (`sweepCert`) — a cheap certified refutation;
2. the fuel-free backward searcher `G4cTm.find` on the **original** sequent —
   the positive engine, returning a kernel-checkable proof term for `Γ ⊢ C`
   (capped at `cfg.findBudget` visited nodes when that is set, via
   `G4cTm.findBounded`; exhaustion degrades this stage to a failed search,
   never to a negative verdict);
3. the closure emitter `emitCert`, gated by `emitClosureCap` — a
   complete-over-the-closure but exponential refuter;
4. `unknown`.

The normaliser feeds only stages 1 and 3 (the untrusted proposers); the
proof term from stage 2 and both refutation certificates are about the
original `Γ`, `C`.

The budget cutoff is told apart from a genuine search-space exhaustion by
the remainder returned by `G4cTm.findBounded`: remainder `0` is a cutoff. -/

/-- **The staged decision procedure** (`settleWhy` with the reason

/-- Compatibility alias for `settle`, under the name this entry point had
before the rename.

Kept as a plain definition rather than `@[deprecated]` on purpose: the name
is used at several dozen call sites across `wip/`, and a deprecation warning
at each of them would drown the build log.  New code should say `settle`
(or, better, the sequent-first `verdict` of §11): `PLLND.Search.decide`
shadows `Decidable.decide` under `open PLLND.Search`, which is exactly what
the rename fixes. -/

These are the two lemmas that make the interface trustworthy.  Each consumes
exactly the certificate that the corresponding `Answer` constructor carries,
so a user goes from a verdict to the corresponding (un)derivability theorem in
one application. -/

/-- A `.proved` certificate yields a natural-deduction derivation.  The chain
is `G4cTm.toG4c` (proof term ⇒ G4c derivation) followed by `G4c.equiv_nd`
(G4c = PLL natural deduction). -/

/-- Positive engine with a **node budget**: `G4cTm.findBounded` capped at
`budget` visited sequents.  A found term is kernel-checkable exactly as with
`prove?`; `none` means only "not settled within `budget` nodes" — an honest
unknown, never a negative verdict.  To tell a genuine search-space
exhaustion (the same `none` as `prove?`) from a budget cutoff, call
`G4cTm.findBounded` directly and inspect the remaining budget; the
difference `budget - remaining` also serves as a node-count profile for
tuning budgets. -/
def prove?Bounded (budget : Nat) (Γ : List PLLFormula) (C : PLLFormula) :
    Option (G4cTm Γ C) :=
  (G4cTm.findBounded budget Γ C).1

/-- Negative engines only (battery then emit, no proof search): a certified
countermodel witness, or `none`. -/
def refute? (cfg : Config := {}) (Γ : List PLLFormula) (C : PLLFormula) :
    Option (Witness Γ C) :=
  let Γ' := Γ.map nf

    if (CounterEmit.closureOf Γ' C').length ≤ cfg.emitClosureCap then
      emitCert Γ' C' Γ C cfg.accept
    else none

/-! ## 10. Sequent-first wrappers

The functions above take the configuration *first*, so a caller who wants
the defaults must still write `{}`.  The three wrappers here take `Γ` and
`C` first and default the configuration, so the common case is short:

```
#eval (verdict [] someSequent).summary
#eval (countermodel [] someSequent).map (·.render)
#eval (proof [] someSequent).map (·.pretty)
```

They default to `budgetedConfig`, **not** to `Config.default`: the node
budget is on (at `defaultFindBudget` = 200000 nodes), because the failure
mode a user actually hits is a run that never comes back.  To turn it off,
or to change anything else, pass the configuration by name:

```
#eval (verdict Γ C (cfg := { findBudget := none })).summary
#eval (verdict Γ C (cfg := { frames := myFrames :: defaultFrames })).summary
```

Nothing about the *existing* entry points changed: `decide {} Γ C` and
`settle {} Γ C` still run with `findBudget := none`, exactly as before. -/

/-- Sequent-first `settleWhy`: the two-sided procedure with reasons, with a
node budget on by default (`budgetedConfig`). -/
def verdictWhy (Γ : List PLLFormula) (C : PLLFormula)
    (cfg : Config := budgetedConfig) : Verdict Γ C :=

/-! ## 11. Rendering: formulas as source, models compactly, and pinning
snippets

Everything in this section is presentation, entirely outside the trust
story.  Its point is to close the discover-then-pin loop: `Witness.snippet`
and `G4cTm.snippet` produce **paste-ready Lean source** for the theorem that
records what the search found, so the manual step of transcribing a `FinCM`
or a rule tree by hand disappears. -/

/-- A `PLLFormula` as Lean source that elaborates back to it.  Fully
qualified and fully parenthesised, so it can be pasted anywhere. -/
def srcOf : PLLFormula → String

/-! ### A compact text picture of a finite model

`repr` on a `FinCM` prints the raw structure, which for an emitted
twenty-world model runs to several screens of pair lists.  `renderCM` prints
one line per world: its `Rᵢ`-cover successors (the transitive reduction, so
the implied edges are not repeated), its `Rₘ` successors, and the atoms it
forces.  `LaxLogic/PLLDiagram.lean` draws the same information as a picture
(`Diagram.toTikz` / `Diagram.toSvg`, over the same transitive reduction
`Diagram.hasseRi`); the two are kept independent so that a user of the
search API need not import the figure machinery, which does file IO. -/

/-- Strict `Rᵢ`: below and not above. -/
private def strictRi' (M : FinCM) (i j : Nat) : Bool :=
  M.riB i j && !(M.riB j i)

/-- Cover (Hasse) edges of the strict part of `Rᵢ`, from world `i`. -/
private def coversFrom (M : FinCM) (i : Nat) : List Nat :=
  (List.range M.n).filter fun j =>
    strictRi' M i j &&
      !((List.range M.n).any fun k =>
          k != i && k != j && strictRi' M i k && strictRi' M k j)

/-- **Compact renderer for a finite constraint model.**  Header line, then
one line per world.  `w?` marks the refuting world.

```

   w1  ⊑> {2}  ⊳ {}   ⊩ p, q
   w2  ⊑> {}   ⊳ {}   ⊩ ⊥ (fallible)
```

`⊑>` lists the `Rᵢ`-**cover** successors (transitive reduction; reflexive
pairs suppressed), `⊳` the `Rₘ` successors, `⊩` the atoms forced; `*` marks
the refuting world.  A fallible world forces everything, so its atom list is
written `⊥`. -/
