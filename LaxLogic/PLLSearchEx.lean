# `PLLSearch` exercised: the Hilbert axioms of PLL

For every Hilbert axiom of PLL (the four ◯-axioms and the nine IPC
axioms, instantiated at atoms p, q, r): first the ANSWERS produced by
`Search.decide`, then the DECISIONS computed from those answers, and
finally a sample kernel-checked extraction of a derivability theorem.

def ans (a : PLLAxiom) : Answer [] a.get := decide {} [] a.get

def isProved {Γ C} : Answer Γ C → Bool
  | .proved _ => true
  | _ => false

def isDerivable {Γ C} : Decision Γ C → Bool
  | .derivable _ => true
  | _ => false

-- Every decision is `.derivable` — i.e. carries the theorem
-- `Nonempty (LaxND [] axiom)` extracted from the proof term.
#guard hilbert.all fun a => isDerivable (dec a)

/-! ## 3. Extraction

Holding an answer, ONE lemma converts a `.proved` verdict into the
derivability theorem: -/

theorem derivable_of_isProved {Γ : List PLLFormula} {C : PLLFormula} :
    ∀ a : Answer Γ C, isProved a = true → Nonempty (LaxND Γ C)
  | .proved t, _ => proved_sound t

/-! A limitation worth knowing: the search functions are defined by
well-founded recursion, so a closed `decide {} Γ C` does NOT reduce in
the kernel — `by decide`/`rfl` cannot evaluate it inside a proof term.
Compile-time verification therefore runs through `#guard` (the
evaluator), as above; certificate EXTRACTION happens by matching on a
computed answer (`match ans a with | .proved t => proved_sound t …`)
wherever the answer is a runtime value, or by pretty-printing the found
`G4cTm` term and transcribing it. -/
