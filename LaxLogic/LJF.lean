# `LJF`: a focused calculus for intuitionistic logic, from the ground up

This file is **self-contained on purpose**.  It imports nothing from the rest
of the development: not `Deriv`, not `G4c`, not the existing interpolation
machinery.  Everything `LJF` needs — weakening, identity expansion, cut — is
built here, for `LJF`, from its own rules.

Matthew's instruction (2026-08-08), and the reason for it:

* the *technique* is what is under test, so borrowing cut-admissibility or
  completeness from another calculus would measure that calculus's metatheory
  rather than this one's;
* a self-contained development reads as a single argument, which a patchwork
  of imports from three calculi does not;
* and reuse is the exact shape of the back-door that nearly imported the
  existing interpolant through `existsP`.

## Naming

`LJF` is Liang–Miller's focused intuitionistic calculus.  What is built here is
the **canonical-polarity instance** of it: every connective sits at its own
polarity (`∨`, `⊥`, atoms positive; `⊃`, `∧` negative) and atoms are *not*
assignable.  Full `LJF` allows the polarity of atoms to be chosen; that freedom
is not needed here and is not implemented, so this is faithful to `LJF` as a
fragment, not as the whole system.  The lax extension in `PLLFocused.lean` is
`LJF◯` — `LJF` plus `◯` and the second judgment.

## The four judgments

    Inv    Γ ; Ω ⇒ N      inversion (asynchronous) phase
    Stab   Γ     ⇒ P      stable sequent: nothing left to invert
    RFocus Γ    ⇒ [P]     right focus on a positive goal
    LFoc   Γ [N] ⇒ P      left focus on a negative hypothesis

`Γ` is the stable context of negatives, `Ω` the queue of positives still to be
inverted.  Focus is entered only at a stable sequent, and left only at a shift.

/-- **Inversion.**  Right rules act on the goal, left rules on the head of
`Ω`; `stable` is the exit, available only when `Ω` is empty and the goal is a
shift.  `Ω` is a stack: the head-only discipline is canonical because every
inversion rule is invertible, so the processing order is immaterial. -/

/-! ## Identity expansion

`LJF`'s only axiom is `init`, at atoms.  That every proposition entails itself
is therefore a **theorem**, and it is proved by the two functions below, which
are the two halves of the same induction on the formula.

* `posRestore Q` says: *inverting `Q` on the left gives it back on the right*.
  To prove `Γ; Q,Ω ⇒ N` it suffices to prove `Γ'; Ω ⇒ N` in the extended
  context `Γ'` produced by inverting `Q`, **with a right focus on `Q` in hand**.
  This is the precise sense in which left inversion loses nothing.

* `idNegK N` says: *if `N` is usable, `N` is provable*.  Given a continuation
  that turns any left focus on `N` into a stable sequent, it builds `Γ ⇒ N`.

The continuations are what make the two mutually recursive without any cut:
`posRestore` hands its caller a `RFocus`, and `idNegK` consumes an `LFoc`. -/

/-! # Part 2: the uniform interpolant, by weighted recursion

## Where the weight enters, and why it is necessary

The interpolant must be **uniform**: one `p`-free formula per antecedent,
serving every goal and every derivation at once.  So it cannot be defined by
recursion on a derivation — it must be defined by recursion on the *sequent*,
following the rules of the calculus applied backwards.

A naive structural measure does not survive that recursion, because the
clauses do not merely decompose — they **transform**:

* currying `(M₁∧M₂ ⊃ N) ↝ (M₁ ⊃ (M₂ ⊃ N))` preserves the naive size;
* splitting `(Q₁∨Q₂ ⊃ N) ↝ (Q₁ ⊃ N), (Q₂ ⊃ N)` *duplicates* `N`;
* inverting a goal `Q ⊃ N` moves `Q` into the context, which *grows*.

The weight repairs all three at once.  Each connective is assigned a cost —
here `atom = ⊥ = 1`, `∨` and `⊃` and `↓` cost `+1`, `∧` costs `+3`, `↑` costs
`0` — and a context is measured by `Σ 3^(weight)`.  The exponential is doing
the work of a multiset order: replacing one hypothesis of weight `w` by at
most two hypotheses of weight `≤ w − 1` drops the sum, because
`2·3^(w−1) < 3^w`.  The costs themselves are **solved for** from the clause
set: each clause contributes an inequality (currying forces `∧ ≥ 3` given the
shift costs; goal-inversion forces `3^{wQ} + 3^{wN} < 3^{wQ+wN+1}`, true since
both weights are positive), and the assignment above is a solution.  Dyckhoff's
weights for `G4ip` are a solution to the same kind of system for a different
rule set; ours differ because the shifts change the clause set.

Why it is necessary and not merely convenient: termination of proof *search*
could be had by loop-checking, but a loop-checker yields no formula.  The
interpolant is *built by* the recursion, so its existence needs structural
well-foundedness — the weight is what turns "the calculus terminates" into
"the interpolant exists".  It is also what buys predicativity: the
interpolation candidate is a least fixed point, and Girard-style candidates
take such fixed points impredicatively; the weight lets this one be reached by
well-founded recursion instead.

/-! ## The uniform interpolant

One recursion computes both quantifiers.  `interp p todo done goal`:

* `goal = none` — **`∃p` mode**: the strongest `p`-free consequence of the
  context `todo ++ done`;
* `goal = some G` — **`∀p` mode**: the weakest `p`-free hypothesis that,
  beside the context, suffices for `G`.

`todo` is the unprocessed part of the context; `done` holds the parked
members, which come in exactly three shapes — atoms `↑a`, implications
`a ⊃ N` whose atom is not yet available, and the Dyckhoff implications
`↓(Q' ⊃ N') ⊃ N`.

The processing clauses consume the head of `todo` and replace it by strictly
lighter material (the residual): this is where each weight inequality is
spent, and each clause is annotated with its inequality.  The aggregate
clauses (at `todo = []`) first fire any parked implication whose atom has
arrived, then read the interpolant off the saturated context.

The measure is `2·sum3 todo + sum3 done + goalW goal`: parking moves a
hypothesis from the doubled side to the single side, so even the bookkeeping
steps are strict, and no lexicographic order is needed. -/

/-! ## The contract that remains

With `interp` total and `interp_pfree` proved, the components of the Σ-type
are in place: the formula, built by the clauses, and its `p`-freeness.  The
characteristic properties are the remaining obligations, stated as the
contract for the next stretch — all four internal to `LJF`, none touching
another calculus:

* **(E1) soundness of `∃p`**:
  `Inv (todo ++ done) [] (interp p todo done none)`
* **(A1) soundness of `∀p`**:
  `Inv (interp p todo done (some G) :: todo ++ done) [] G`
* **(E2) minimality of `∃p`**: for `p`-free `Δ` and `ψ`,
  `Inv (todo ++ done ++ Δ) [] ψ  →  Inv (interp p todo done none :: Δ) [] ψ`
* **(A2) minimality of `∀p`**: for `p`-free `Δ`,
  `Inv (todo ++ done ++ Δ) [] G  →
     Inv (interp p todo done none :: Δ) [] (interp p todo done (some G))`

**Status (2026-08-09, later)**: E1 and A1 are `eSound`/`aSound`, proved
unconditionally in Part 4.  E2 and A2 are `eMin`/`aMin` in Part 5, proved
modulo the saturated-context statements `SatE2`/`SatA2` — the one remaining
mountain, carried as explicit hypotheses.  The minimality analysis also
forced the E-guards on the two branching `∀p` clauses of `interp`.

The toolkit they need, also internal: a hypothesis-simulation traversal
(replace uses of one hypothesis by a derived simulator — powers E1/A1 and the
easy inversion directions of E2/A2), and branch extraction
(`Inv Δ (P :: Ω) C → ∀ b ∈ invertPos P, Inv (b ++ Δ) Ω C`, from the
determinism of the inversion phase).  The one expected mountain is the
`E2`/`A2` case for the Dyckhoff implication — the focused form of the
`(A⊃B)⊃C` argument; if it resists, it is to be carried as an explicit
hypothesis, never a `sorry`. -/


/-! # Part 3: the toolkit for the characteristic properties

Six tools, each internal to `LJF`, each structural, none using cut:

* `routeStab` — CPS re-targeting of a stable proof of a positive `P`: every
  right focus on `P` is handed to a continuation, every left-focus chain and
  goal-side inversion is rebuilt with the new target.  Its instances do the
  work classically assigned to cut: shift release, disjunction routing,
  ex falso from a provable `⊥`.
* `invBranches` — realise `invertPos` on the left: branch derivations
  assemble into the inversion of the positive.
* `extract` — the converse, at any position of `Ω`: the inversion phase is
  deterministic, so a pending positive can be replayed along any one branch.
* `stableFire` — fire a shifted hypothesis `↑R` at a stable sequent, given
  stable continuations for every branch of `R`.
* `upMerge` — eliminate a shifted hypothesis into a negative goal, by
  recursion on the goal; the leaf case is `stableFire`.
* `simStab` — hypothesis simulation: replace every use of one hypothesis
  `H` by derivations manufactured on the other side.  The `init` uses of an
  atomic `H` reduce to left-focus uses via `idPos`, so one handler covers
  everything.

/-! ## The residual simulator

Uses of the residual `↓N′ ⊃ N` are manufactured from the Dyckhoff hypothesis
`↓(Q′ ⊃ N′) ⊃ N` itself: a use supplies a stable proof of `↓N′`; routing it
(`routeStab`) releases an inversion of `N′`, which — weakened under the
inversion of `Q′` — rebuilds the stronger antecedent `↓(Q′ ⊃ N′)`, and the
hypothesis fires.  This is the derivability of `(A⊃B)⊃C ⊢ B⊃C`, in focused
form, with no cut. -/

/-! # Part 5: minimality of both modes

`eMin`: any `p`-free consequence of the context follows from its `∃p`
interpolant.  `aMin`: any way a context beside `p`-free material reaches the
goal factors through the `∀p` interpolant.  The processing phase is proved
here outright: each clause's *inverse* transformation — replacing uses of the
consumed hypothesis by uses of its residual — is one `simulate` instance.
What remains is the saturated case, isolated below as `SatE2`/`SatA2`.

/-! # Part 6: the saturated case — the inner induction

The plan, fixed by the analysis of 2026-08-09:

* One traversal over the four judgments, structural in the derivation, at a
  fixed saturated parked station `done`, with the context split as
  `done`-part plus a `p`-free kept part `K`.
* Uses of `done`-members are dispatched through the matching conjunct of the
  interpolant; the continuation after a fire is packaged as a derivation
  over the fired context (`d_cont`), cleaned of residual uses of the fired
  member, and handed to the minimality function at strictly smaller measure.
* Proofs of the atom `p` at the main line are eliminated by **composition**:
  `init` on `↑p` is impossible (saturation excludes `↑p` beside `p ⊃ M`;
  the kept side is `p`-free), so every such proof bottoms out in a fire
  whose body releases the `p`-material — and at that node all pieces exist
  to compose the outer `p ⊃ M` use with the inner fire directly.
* The single dispatch that does not close by these means is the Dyckhoff
  antecedent — deriving `∀p` of the antecedent at the residual station from
  a main-line stable proof of it.  It is isolated as `DykAnt`, one
  statement serving both modes.
