# Completeness of PLL for presented-strategy realisability

The composition of the two halves of the programme:

* `emitter_completeness` (`PLLFinComp.lean`) — every underivable sequent
  has a finite countermodel as verified checker data, by the Zorn-free
  canonical model;
* `realP_refutes_sequent_tbl` (`PLLEvidence.lean`) — every checked
  countermodel, decorated with token evidence over the explicit table
  algebra, is a `⊩ᵖ`-refutation: hypotheses realised, conclusion
  unrealisable.

`realP_countermodel_of_underivable` chains them; together with soundness
and the adequacy/fullness bridge it sharpens to the biconditional
`derivable_iff_no_realP_refutation`: a sequent is derivable exactly when
no token-decorated checked finite model realisability-refutes it.

Every quantifier here ranges over concrete objects — finite models as
printable data, evidence with one token per atom, realisers in an explicit
algebra of finite lookup tables — and the countermodel construction is the
iterated *decided* extension of `PLLFinComp.lean`: no Zorn.  The
`#print axioms` audit currently carries `Classical.choice` inherited from
the decidability infrastructure; the mathematics is finitary throughout.

/-- **Completeness of PLL for `⊩ᵖ`-realisability**: a sequent is derivable
exactly when no token-decorated checked finite model realisability-refutes
it.  Forward: soundness plus adequacy and fullness — a derivable
conclusion is forced wherever its realised hypotheses are, hence realised
by its fullness witness.  Backward: the countermodel construction above;
the case decision is by the mechanised decision procedure, not excluded
middle. -/
