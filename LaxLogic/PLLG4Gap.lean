# G4iLL is incomplete: a machine-checked separation from G3iLL

Iemhoff's calculus G4iLL (*Proof Theory for Lax Logic*, arXiv:2209.08976,
Fig. 2.3 — our `G4`) was claimed equivalent to G3iLL (our `SC`) via the
general Theorem 1 of *The G4i analogue of a G3i calculus*
(arXiv:2011.11847).  This file refutes the equivalence, with both sides
machine-checked:

* `SC [◯G', F'] r` is derived below, where `F' = ◯p → r` and
  `G' = F' → ◯p`;
* `decide (G4 [◯G', F'] r) = false` by the *verified* decision procedure
  of `PLLDecide` (whose completeness over the `G4` rules is a theorem).

The sequent is PLL-valid: bind on `◯G'` — inside the box, `G'` and the
(reused!) hypothesis `F'` give `◯p` — so `◯p` holds outright, and `F'`
then yields `r`.  The G3 derivation below uses `F'` **twice**: once
inside the `laxL` box-opening, once as the final implication.  G4iLL's
`L◯→` (`impLLaxLax`) reuses the *box* across its premises but *consumes
the implication*, and its first premise `G' ⇒ ◯p` is invalid — so no G4
rule instance closes the sequent.  This is Howe's duplication phenomenon
(MSCS 2001) one level up: the formula needing contraction is the
`◯`-antecedent implication itself, straddling a box-opening.

Consequently the modal case of Theorem 1 of arXiv:2011.11847 fails as
stated (its premises `Sᵢ` carry an extra copy of `◯φ→ψ`, so `Sᵢ ≪ S`
does not hold, and the copy cannot be dropped), and Corollary 1 of
arXiv:2209.08976 with it.  A `⊥`-instantiated variant is included to
show even the constant-only fragment separates.  The decidability
development of `PLLDecide` is untouched — it decides `G4` — but a
repaired calculus is needed before it decides PLL.

/-! ## Contraction is not admissible in G4iLL

With **two** copies of `F'` the separation sequent *is* derivable: one
copy is consumed by `impLLaxLax` (box `◯G'`), whose first premise
`G', F' ⇒ ◯p` spends the second copy inside the box-opening (via
`impLImp` on `G'` and `impLLaxLax` again, box `◯p`).  Together with the
`false` verdict on the single-copy sequent above, this machine-checks
that the contraction rule is **not** admissible in G4iLL — the very
hypothesis the referee-patched Theorem 3.4 of Studia Logica 110 (2022)
added, and the substance of Howe's conjecture (MSCS 2001, §5), whose
example this is (in packaged form). -/
