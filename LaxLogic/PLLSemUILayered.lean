# The Litak–Visser route: layered bisimulations for PLL

Following A. Visser, *Uniform interpolation and layered bisimulation*
(Gödel '96) and T. Litak & A. Visser, *Lewis and Brouwer meet Strong
Löb* (arXiv:2404.11969) §4.3–§5.1, which prove uniform interpolation
SEMANTICALLY for IPC/K/GL and for iSL — the latter an intuitionistic
modal logic sharing PLL's Strength axiom φ → ◯φ.  This file sets up
their machinery over our constraint models and states the pillar
lemmas of their route in our terms; the pillars that are theirs to
adapt are `sorry`-marked and named, so each can be attacked (or
refuted) separately.

## The route (their numbering)

1. **Complexity** c(φ): atoms/⊥ cost 0, ∧/∨ take max, →/⊰ add 1.
   Our ◯ is interpreted by the ∀∃-clause (an Rᵢ-move THEN an Rₘ-move),
   so it costs 2 here (`crank`); their Lewis arrow costs 1.  The
   fragment `C_r(V)` of p-free formulas of complexity ≤ r is finite up
   to interderivability (their Thm 4.5 for IPC; `frag_reps_exist`,
   OPEN for PLL — expected from the finite canonical model).
2. **Layered (bounded) bisimulation** (their §4.3): a level-indexed
   relation; atoms and fallibility demanded at EVERY level; the four
   zigzags each spend one level.  `LayeredBisim`.
3. **Rank preservation** (their Thm 4.6): a level-n link transfers
   forcing of formulas of complexity ≤ n.  PROVED below
   (`force_iff_of_layered`), with the unbounded invariance
   `force_iff_of_bisim` recovered as the constant-family corollary —
   the consistency test for the definitions.
4. **Characters** (their Thm 4.7): fragment-agreement at rank n
   conversely yields a level-n link, via the finite conjunction θ⁺ and
   disjunction θ⁻ of the rank-n fragment.  `layered_of_frag_agree`
   (OPEN).
5. **THE AMALGAMATION LEMMA** (their Lemma 5.4; Visser's Lemma 5.1):
   from a level-(2ν+1) link between k₀ and m₀ protecting the shared
   alphabet, a p-variant of M whose root agrees with k₀ on the whole
   adequate set.  Their proof: the amalgam's worlds are pairs
   ⟨Δ, m⟩ = (theory in the finite pre-Henkin model over X, world of
   M), admissible when a WITNESSING TRIPLE k′ ≼ k, k′ Z_{2d(k′)+1} m′,
   k Z_{2d(k′)} m exists — the budget is financed by the DEPTH d of
   the theory coordinate in the finite Henkin model, so near-maximal
   theories need almost no matching.  `amalgamation` (OPEN for PLL).

## Match against our development

* Their amalgam ⟨Δ, m⟩-pairs = our description graft's fibres
  (`descGraft`); their valuation "Δ ⊩ a or m ⊩ a" agrees with ours on
  shared atoms and reads the Henkin side for the quantified atom —
  our redecoration.  MATCH.
* Their budget bookkeeping is the exact repair of our measured dead
  end: our unbounded pairing (`Realises`) demanded zigzags at every
  level against the full canonical model and was computed EMPTY on
  F-free rows; the uniform depth-bounded approximants die by level 3.
  Their witnessing triples demand level 2d+1 only, d = Henkin depth
  of the theory — the everything-affirming theory has maximal depth,
  budget ≈ 0, and is harmless.  MISMATCH → their form wins.
* Their Θ⁺ ⊬ Θ⁻ ∨ φ underivability step (Thm 5.1(2)) is the
  rank-completed form of our pre-triple consistency
  (`preTripleAll_cons_of_residue` proved it NECESSARY); their
  characters replace our closure-only description by the full
  rank-bounded fragment.  PARTIAL MATCH — ours is the subformula
  shadow of theirs.
* Genuinely new for PLL, absent from iSL: fallible worlds (their
  frames have irreflexive ⊏ with dead ends where PLL needs F — our
  fallibility-absorption lemmas in `descGraft_force_iff` are the
  candidate technology), the interaction Rₘ ⊆ Rᵢ with BOTH relations
  reflexive, and the promise component of canonical theories (their
  theories are plain sets; our `trace_mforth` shows promises are
  functorial along Rₘ — the extra bookkeeping the ◯-clause needs).
  Their Remark 5.5: "something more complicated needs to be done for
  other intuitionistic modal logics" — this is that something.

/-! ## 3′. The WEAKENED layered bisimulation (the repaired form)

The refutation below shows the full zigzags are too strong for PLL;
the repair is the `DescPack` clause shape: the i-zigzags may escape
at a fallible target (which forces everything, so constrains
nothing), the m-zigzags may pair fallible witnesses.  Rank
preservation goes through unchanged — every escape absorbs by
`force_of_fallible`, exactly as in `descGraft_force_iff` — and the
probe (wip/mforth_probe.lean: 2324 agreeing pairs, 0 candidates)
supports that THIS form is derivable from fragment-agreement. -/

/-! ## 3″. The m-escape geography (machine-checked from both sides)

The probe (wip/mforth_probe.lean) reports 0 violations of the
NON-fallible forth-m clause across 2324 agreeing pairs, but 82
violations of the fallible-PAIR escape.  Both boundary facts are
theorems below:

* `weak_escape_breaks_force_iff`: with the weak m-escape (no
  obligation at a fallible row-member), rank preservation FAILS — a
  fallible row-member finances ◯⊥ on one side with nothing to match
  it on the other.  So `LayeredBisimE`'s pair escape is the weakest
  form supporting `force_iff_of_layeredE`.
* `pair_escape_not_from_agreement`: the pair escape is NOT derivable
  from fragment-agreement — the fork with one fallible m-branch
  agrees with the lone point on every variable-free formula, but the
  lone point's row has no fallible member.

CONSEQUENCE (the settled design): pillar 2 can only produce the WEAK
form `LayeredBisimW` below; the amalgamation must therefore not
consume the link's m-clauses for its ◯-case, routing instead through
the promise components (`mfal`) of the canonical coordinate — the
reason Fairtlough–Mendler theories carry promises at all.  The
E-form stays as the OUTPUT format (what `wit_pbisim` produces), the
W-form as the INPUT format (what agreement delivers). -/

/-! ## 4. The sorried pillars (each a separate target)

The statements below are the PLL forms of the remaining steps of the

refuted by the oracle on instances — independently. -/

/- **Fragment finiteness up to interderivability** (their Thm 4.5
analogue): PROVED as `frag_reps_exist'` in `PLLSemUIFrag.lean`
(DNF-over-components construction, sorry-free). -/

/-! ### Pillar 2: their Theorem 4.7 is REFUTED for PLL as stated

Their proof takes Z at level α := agreement at rank α.  For PLL this
CANNOT satisfy the `iforth` zigzag of `LayeredBisim`: adding a
fallible top with a trivial row to a model is conservative — "some
Rᵢ-successor is fallible" is not a hereditary property, so no formula
expresses it — yet the fallible successor demands a fallible partner
through the `fall` clause.  Machine-checked below on the two-point
chain against `oneW`.  (Litak–Visser never meet this: their frames
replace fallible worlds by irreflexive dead ends.)

The redesign boundary this fixes precisely: the ESCAPE form of
`iforth` (partner OR the successor is fallible, as in `DescPack`)
survives the character argument — a NON-fallible successor `v`
refutes its θ⁻ (a fallible one forces everything, breaking `v ⊮ θ⁻`),
so the implication argument still produces a partner exactly when one
is demanded.  The open pillar-2 question is therefore the m-clauses:
which row-zigzag weakening is both agreement-derivable and strong
enough for the two-case budget argument of `wit_pbisim`. -/

Given an adequate set X, a model K whose root k₀ is layered-bisimilar
to m₀ ∈ M at level 2·(nu X)+1 protecting everything but p, there is a
p-VARIANT of M (unbounded bisimulation!) whose root agrees with k₀ on
all of X.

X-prime theory of the finite pre-Henkin model and m ∈ M, admissible
when a witnessing triple k′ ≼ k, k′ Z_{2d(k′)+1} m′, k Z_{2d(k′)} m
exists (d = Henkin depth of Δ); relations componentwise; atoms from
the union of the coordinates.  PLL additions needed: the fallibility
clauses (F-absorption as in `descGraft_force_iff`), the frame
conditions Rₘ ⊆ Rᵢ and reflexivity of Rₘ on the amalgam, and the
promise components of the canonical theories in the ◯-case (where
their ⊏-maximality trick, which uses irreflexivity/Löb, must be
replaced by idempotence-and-promise reasoning). -/

/-! ## 5. What the pillars would buy (the route's exit)

With `frag_reps_exist`, `layered_of_frag_agree` and `amalgamation`
in hand, their Theorem 5.1(2) argument yields, for every formula M
and variable p, that the rank-bounded join

  ∀p.M  :=  ⋁ { D ∈ Frag_{2ν+1}(V∖{p}) | D ⊢ M },   ν := nu (Sub M)

satisfies the full semantic specification `IsSemAll p M (that join)`
— and dually the meet at rank 2ν+2 for ∃p.  The residues
`BoxRowAmalgAll/Ex` of the box-commutation law become instances: the
row hypothesis contradicts the character-underivability
Θ⁺ ⊬ Θ⁻ ∨ ◯φ (the rank-completed form of our proved
`preTripleAll_cons_of_residue`), completeness produces the model K,
characters produce the layered link, and `amalgamation` produces the
p-variant the residue demands. -/
